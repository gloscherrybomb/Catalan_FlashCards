Review the functionality from the perspective of an end user, ensuring all functionality is robust and works as expected, as well as ensuring it is effective for learning Catalan. Score it out of 100. Use plan mode for necessary improvements, and frontend-design for any frontend changes. After implementing, review and score again. Focus on resolving usability bugs, like not being able to progress through a function properly, statistics not updating, or questions requiring inappropriate answers (like needing you to include the gender). Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when done.
