What is Colloquial
Catalan ?
This book is part of the Routledge Colloquial series. ‘Colloquial’ is
used with its full original meaning of ‘spoken language’ and not with
the meaning often favoured by Catalan-speakers of ‘informal’, even
‘vulgar’ language.
Colloquial Catalan is a course for absolute beginners which
offers the possibility of learning enough spoken Catalan to commu-nicate effectively in real-life situations. The topics included cover
daily life, travel, work and leisure, making it suitable for the cultural
traveller, those starting a new life in a Catalan-speaking area, andthe university student who needs to learn the language in a shortperiod of time.
Colloquial Catalan is structured around sequences of life-like dia-
logues which offer access to the key aspects of the language and the
culture of the Catalan-speaking peoples. In this way the language is
always presented in a meaningful context. After studying the ﬁrstfew units you will be able to engage in simple communication andgain the respect of local people. The book covers the main aspectsof Catalan grammar and develops your listening and speaking skills,
together with reading and, to a lesser extent, writing.
Individual learning and group teaching
Colloquial Catalan is designed mainly with the self-learner in mind.
It requires no previous language learning experience because the
explanations are as straightforward and gradual as possible, and areillustrated with examples. The course offers the basic ingredients of language learning: exposure to the language, clear explanationsand opportunities to practise. Therefore, it can be easily adapted 
to small group and classroom teaching. If used in the classroom, 
it offers the advantage of freeing the tutor from spending timeexplaining the language. This is particularly useful when the tutor is

not an English native speaker, as is often the case, and is not aware
of the way some English speakers can be challenged by grammar.
The Catalan language
Catalan is a Romance language with many similarities to otherlanguages in this group, such as Portuguese, Italian or Spanish.
Catalan also shares many features with English, which helps makeit easy to learn. If you look at some of the texts you should be ableto identify quite a few words, even before you start your studies. 
There are close to seven million speakers of Catalan in the
eastern part of the Iberian Peninsula who have it as their mother
tongue, another 4 million understand Catalan and use it passively.It is also spoken in other areas linked to Catalonia by history andgeography: Andorra, where it is the ofﬁcial language, Cerdagne andRoussillon, in what is now south-eastern France, and L’Alguer
(Alghero), on the island of Sardinia. Catalan is less well known in
the English-speaking world than several other European languageswith fewer speakers, because the areas where it is spoken do notcorrespond to the boundaries of a state. It was only relativelyrecently that interest in the language has become more widespreadin anglophone countries. One factor has been the consolidation of
Barcelona as a favourite tourist destination, especially since the
Olympic Games of 1992. 
This course focuses mainly on the Catalan spoken in the area of
Barcelona and central eastern Catalonia, a variety sometimesreferred to as the central or standard variety, which predominates
in the media and education system. Catalan is also spoken in other
areas well known to the modern traveller, such as the BalearicIslands and Valencia, where the language has its own distinctivefeatures and its own creative force. Learners whose interest islinked to these areas will still ﬁnd this book useful. The mainfeatures of the language are the same, and you will soon pick up
the differences by listening closely to local speakers. Speaking as
the locals do is, after all, an important aim of all language learners.
How is the course structured?
The course is divided into 20 units which in turn are divided into
dialogues linked by a theme. Most learners may choose to cover1111

one dialogue during each session of study. Our advice is that you
should consider each dialogue as the basic unit of study, because
short frequent sessions tend to be the most productive way ofapproaching language learning.
Units 1–5 are short, and focus on getting used to the sounds of
the language, developing good comprehension habits and becoming
familiar with the basic grammar. Units 6–10 cover most essential
vocabulary and structures for daily tasks, such as talking about the
family, going shopping for food and going out. In units 11–20 the
level of difﬁculty increases and more advanced points of grammar
are introduced progressively.
How to work on each dialogue?
The recordings are a fundamental part of this course. Much can belearnt from the written text on its own, but the ability to understandwhat others are saying is a key aspect of communication andlistening to the audio will allow you to imitate native speakers. 
Here is the recommended procedure to follow with each of the
dialogues:
1) Read the rubric that precedes the dialogue so that you know the
context in which it takes place.
2) Resist the temptation to read the written version of the dialogue
ﬁrst. It is much better if ﬁrst you listen carefully to the audio, justas you would do when someone talks to you or when you hearan announcement, situations in which you don’t have any writtenhelp.
3) Listen to the dialogue at least twice. Try to ﬁnd out or guess what
is going on and what the characters are saying.
4) Now look at the written text.
5) Check the Vocabulary and read the Culture notes and the
Language points .
6) When you understand what the text means and you have read
the grammar points, you should listen to or read the dialogueagain, paying special attention to how things are said and howthe language is used.
7) Complete the Exercises relating to the dialogue or to the whole
unit if appropriate.x

Complementary sections
The Pronunciation guide is no substitute for listening carefully to
the audio and imitating native speakers, but it may help you withaspects of the sound system and intonation.
The Grammar reference extends and complements some areas
of grammar and allows for quick reference, especially of verbendings.
The Language builders have a similar function in relation to
vocabulary and basic expressions.
The Catalan–English glossary includes most words that appear
in the book. The English–Catalan glossary includes only words
needed to complete the exercises.
The Key to exercises allows you to check your responses.
Feedback
We would very much welcome any feedback on the experience of
using this course and how it may be improved. Please e-mail orwrite to the authors at Routledge.
Dictionaries and further reading
You are going to ﬁnd a bilingual dictionary very useful, particularlyin the second half of the course, where not all the words are listedin the glossaries. Of the mid-size and affordable dictionaries we recommend: Diccionari Oxford Pocket Català per a estudiants
d’anglès (Oxford University Press, second edition, Oxford, 2002),
and Larousse Diccionari Pocket: Català-Anglès, English-Catalan
(Larousse, Barcelona, 2000). The latter includes pronunciation ofCatalan words. 
The most up-to-date and authoritative Grammar in English 
is: Max. W. Wheeler, Alan Yates and Nicolau Dolç, Catalan: A
Comprehensive Grammar (Routledge, London, 1999). 
For a modern introduction in English to the culture, history and
literature, which is especially strong on modernisme : Robert
Hughes, Barcelona (Harvill, London, 1992). Also highly informa-
tive are Colm Tóibín, Homage to Barcelona (Picador paperback,
London, 2002) and John Payne, Catalonia: History and Culture
(Five Leaves Publications, Nottingham, 2004).1111

Pronunciation
To achieve good pronunciation there is no substitute for listening
to the audio and if possible to native speakers. Try to reproducethe sounds you hear. Below are guidelines to keep in mind. Notethat they relate to the pronunciation of ‘central’ Catalan sounds anddo not include regional variations.
Colloquial pronunciation 1: 
consonants which differ from English
The sounds represented by Catalan consonants are very similar to
English. The main difference is that consonants like b,d,g,p,t,
have a softer pronunciation. Other differences are described below.
b/v After a vowel: softer than English, with only slight
contact between the lips; auto bús,avió,habitual . [b]
ce/ci/ç Always pronounced like /s/ in city; c ervesa, àcid,pla ça,
Bar ça. [s]
d 1) Between vowels and after r: like the /th/ in theorthat;
vida,Gau dí,per dó. [ð]
2) At the end of a word : Like the /t/ in ﬂatorhotbut
softer; líqui d,fre d,ver d. [t]
ge/gi/je Like /s/ in measure and vision or /g/ in general; jardí,
pro jecció ,general . [z] [dȝ]
h Always silent, not pronounced; home ,hotel,història .
l·l Represents a reinforced /l/ sound; inte l·ligent ,nove l·la. [ll]
r 1) In initial position and after l, m, n, s : rolled with the tip
of tongue against the hard palate; Rambla ,Roma . [rr]
2) In intermediate positions : pronounced with a single
contact of tongue against palate; Mi ró,Girona,Costa
Brava. [r]
3) In ﬁ nal position : it is silent, not pronounced. This is
the case with inﬁnitives and many nouns; estudia r,
professo r,parado r.xiv

=== PAGE 16 ===

s Between vowels: pronounced like /z/ in lazy, no seor
doe s;casa,mú sica,rosa. [z]
t 1) In most positions the pronunciation is like takeor
cos t, with the tip of tongue against the top teeth;
Tarragona ,cos tar. [t]
2) In a ﬁ nal position after /l/, /n/, or in the group /rts/ it is
not pronounced; mol t,dependen t,dimar ts
x 1) At the beginning of a word : it is pronounced like the
/sh/ of English shus ;xocolata ,Xina,xoriço . [ʃ]
2) In other positions : the pronunciation is similar to
English in exoticorﬁx;exòtic,ﬁxar,èxit. [ks] [gz]
Colloquial pronunciation 2: 
word stress
On hearing Catalan words you will note that part of the word
carries the main stress. For example: Barcelona , pronounced Bar-
ce-LO-na , and universitat pronounced u-ni-ver-si-TAT . Words of
one syllable are stressed with the exception of articles, somepronouns and some prepositions. As always the best advice is to
listen carefully and imitate what you hear. 
However, when you come across a word in writing, except in
some good dictionaries which tell you where the stress is, you canonly know where to place the stress by following 3 simple rules thatapply to most words.
1. Stress falls on the next-to-last syllable of words ending in either:
a single vowel (e.g. TarraGOna ,PALma ,AnDOrra )
vowel + s (cerVEses ,CAses ,RAMbles )
-en,-in (viSIten )
2. Words ending in a consonant usually carry the stress on the 
ﬁnal syllable (e.g. restaurANT ,vocAL ,consonANT, hoTEL ,
visiTAr ).
3. Where neither 1 or 2 apply, stress is indicated with a written
accent mark on the syllable which carries it (i.e. MÚsica ,
teLÈfon ,americÀ ,anglÈS ).1111

Colloquial pronunciation 3: 
vowel sounds 
Catalan vowel sounds are generally shorter and sharper than in
English
Unstressed and stressed i and u
i Like the isound in t each (p each, mar ine, s een) but shorter
and sharper; pizza,pintura ,difícil. [i]
u Similar to the uin pull (put, full, bull);ridíc ul,número ,
furiós. [u]
Unstressed a, e and o
a/e Both unstressed aand unstressed erepresent a relaxed
neutral sound similar to fath er, sug ar, inf ant,annoy.
Examples are: hol a, Giron a, Sagrad aFamili a,par e,mar e. [ə]
o Unstressed ois the same sound as the letter u;Montserrat ,
oral,al·leg oria. [u]
Stressed a, e and o
a Between the /a/ sounds in English cat(but more open) and
card;Sagr ada,visit ar,àlgebra . [á]
e Open eis like the /e/ in English s ell (get, bed,air);caf è, terra,
telèfon,comit è. [ε´]
Closed eis like the esound in n eighbour or r ain (without the
isound); acc és,congr és,prud ent. [é]
o Open ois like in the English l ogic ( obvious , omnivore,
opera); home,dona,òpera ,lògica. [ɔ]
Closed ois like the English in author or order; Barcel ona,
est ómac,aut or. [ó]xvi

=== PAGE 18 ===

Four considerations in relation to Catalan vowels :
1 By looking at the examples you will notice that Catalan uses both
thegrave oropen (`) and the acute orclose (´) written accents.
A graphic accent mark is used only in words that do not followrules 1 and 2 of word stress (see above). The grave accent is usedfor open stressed vowels and the acute for close stressed vowels.
Stressed ais always ‘open’ and is written with the grave accent
àand iand uare always ‘close’ written when appropriate as í
and ú, as in the examples in the chart above.
2 As seen on the previous page, eand ocan be sometimes ‘open’
and sometimes ‘close’. When eand ohave an accent it is easy to
know whether the sounds are ‘open’ ( è,ò) or ‘close’ ( é,ó).
However, if there is no written accent it is difﬁcult to know unlesswe hear someone pronouncing the word or we pay close atten-tion to the audio. Do not worry about this point. It does not
normally interfere with comprehension and you will gradually
master it. Take into account that there are some regional varia-tions in the pronunciation of open/close vowels which allow foradaptability between listeners and speakers. However, whenwriting, all users adopt the conventions outlined here.
3 Many words have two vowel sounds next to each other (diph-
thongs). In most cases they are pronounced as separate sounds,for example: oasi,client . However, if the second sound is ‘i’ or
‘u’ the / i/ sound changes to the sound of the English / y/ in day
(for example: espai ,Lleida ) and the / u/ sound changes to the
sound of the English / w/ in now. For example: autobús, G audí,
Salou,euro, c iutat.
4 When a word ﬁnishes in a vowel and the next word starts also
with a vowel (above all unstressed eand a), they are usually run
together (word liaison). For example: un aamiga meva v aa
Anglaterr aae studiar. This is an important feature for two
reasons: 1) Once you have mastered it, your speech will soundmuch more natural; and 2) In the early stages of contact with the
language, the running of words together can be a challenge to
the untrained ear.1111

Colloquial pronunciation 4: 
single sounds represented by two letters (digraphs)
Note that digraphs represent one sound. So, for example, caixa is
pronounced /casha/, the ibefore the x, in this case, represents the
sound /sh/ (as opposed to the sound /x/ in èxit /egsit/).
qu 1)que,qui: is pronounced like /k/ in cat,kick,chemical ,
orcurtain ;que,quilòmetre ,orquestra. [k]

orgold ;guerra,guitarra . [g]
2)gua,guo,güe,güi: /wa/ in water orambiguity ;aigua,

ll Sounds like /l/ and /y/ together pronounced like lliin
million ;llibertat ,lluna,llengua . [ʎ]
l·l Represents a reinforced /l/ sound; inte l·ligent ,nove l·la.
[ll]
ny Sounds like /n/ and /y/ together as in onion;Catalu nya,
Espa nya. [/nlefthookatleft]
rr Is a rolled sound, pronounced like Catalan /r/ in initial
position; Ando rra,Medite rrani. [rr]
ss Like /s/ in initial position, the same as Picasso ,pass or
classic in English; Pica sso,passar,clà ssic. [s]
-ix After a vowel -ixis pronounced like /sh/ in shush ;Ca ixa,
Eixample . [ʃ]
-tx/-ig Sounds like /tch/ in English as in match orcatch ;cotxe ,
sandvitx ,maig ,desig . [/teshlig]xviii

1 Benvinguda i
benvingut!
Welcome!
In this unit you will learn about:
• Meeting and greeting people
• The present tense of ser‘to be’
• Subject pronouns: ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘he’, ‘she’, etc.• Personal articles•Tuandvostè
• The gender of nouns and adjectives
Welcome ( benvinguda orbenvingut ) to our Catalan course! Our
journey begins, like so many, at the airport, a typical place for meet-ings and greetings. At ﬁrst you will be dealing with familiar situa-tions and you may be able to make out the gist of the conversationsin the opening dialogues, and perhaps even identify some words.
Throughout the course, we strongly recommend that you listen
to the audio before looking at the text of the dialogue. In this wayyou will soon be able to cope with real situations in which Catalanis used. In such situations you will be talking to people without anywritten support, so start as you mean to ﬁnish!
Dialogue 1 
Rachel and Sara meet for the ﬁrst time at Barcelona airport. Saratries to ﬁnd out if she is talking to the right person and welcomes
Rachel to Barcelona.
• Listen carefully to the audio twice and see how much you can
recognise.1111

From now on, to help focus on comprehension whilst you listen to
the audio, dialogues will often be preceded by questions or other
activities. In most cases the answers can be checked when you look
at the written version of the dialogue. The language pointsbelonging to this dialogue will be explained after the next dialogue;now go straight on to Dialogue 2.
Dialogue 2 
Two travellers, senyora Mata and Rosa Garcia, are met by a hotel
representative ( representant ), senyor Massip, who mistakes senyora
Mata for Rosa Garcia. As in Dialogue 1, listen to this dialogue twicebefore looking at the text.
• What‘s the name of the hotel?2

REPRESENTANT Hola, bon dia. Vostè és la senyora Garcia?
SENYORA MATA No, la senyora Garcia és ella, jo sóc la senyora
Mata. I vostè qui és?
REPRESENTANT Jo sóc el senyor Massip de l’Hotel Central.
SENYORA MATA Molt de gust.
REPRESENTANT Encantat.

Language points
The verb ser‘to be’ 1
The verb ser‘to be’ takes the following forms for the present tense:
Singular (jo) sóc I am
(tu) ets you are (familiar)
(vostè/ell/ella) és you are (formal), he/she is
Plural (nosaltres) som we are
(vosaltres) sou you are (familiar)
(vostès/ells/elles) són you are (formal), they are
The subject pronoun, shown here in brackets, is generally used only
for emphasis, as in the ﬁrst exchanges in our dialogue, when ques-tions of identity are so important. Otherwise, the form of the verb1111

itself is sufﬁcient to indicate person (‘I’, ‘you’, ‘she’, etc.) and
number (singular or plural). Normally, senyora Mata would intro-
duce herself by saying simply: sóc la senyora Mata .
The article 1: the personal article
You will have observed how in Dialogue 1 the names of Sara and
Rachel are preceded by la. This is called the ‘personal article’ 
and is used before ﬁrst names. The masculine form is el:sóc el Jordi
(= I’m Jordi); ets el Martin? (= are you Martin?). Eland laare also
used in front of senyor and senyora . Example: vostè és la senyora
Massip?
Note that when you are addressing a person without using the
verb ‘to be’, no article is used, as when Sra. Mata in the dialogue
says to her friend: Rosa . . . Similarly, if she were using her friend’s
title and surname, to attract her attention she would say: senyora
Garcia, el senyor Massip de l’Hotel Central .
Tuand vostè 1
Dialogues 1 and 2 illustrate the contrast between a context in 
which the familiar ( tu) form of address is appropriate (the speakers
are on ﬁrst-name terms) and a more formal one where vostè is
the proper convention. Note that vostè uses the third person of the
verb, the same as ‘he’/‘she’.
Nouns 1
Nouns in Catalan, in common with the other Romance languages,
are either masculine or feminine, and have a singular and plural
form. In our vocabulary lists the gender of the noun is indicated bythe preceding masculine or feminine article (= the): elorla. In a
few cases the noun will be followed by (m.) or (f.) to indicate if itis masculine or feminine. In this respect dictionaries are very useful,
as they not only tell you the meaning of words, but also give you
other information. Consider the entry: felicitat n.f. happiness . The
abbreviation n.f.tells you that the word is a feminine noun – and
n.m. that it is a masculine noun. It is worthwhile spending a few
minutes reading the introduction to your dictionary to learn how toget the most out of it.4

=== PAGE 26 ===

Adjectives 1
Another important point brought out in these ﬁrst two dialogues is
how the word encantada is used by women and encantat by men.
This is because it is an adjective and adjectives in Catalan alwaysagree with the noun to which they refer. If the noun is masculinethe adjective will be masculine, if the noun is feminine the adjec-tive is feminine. This means that adjectives have two forms. In our
vocabulary lists we give the masculine singular form ﬁrst, with an
indication of the feminine singular form: encantat ,-ada (=encan-
tada ).Benvinguda andbenvingut referring to you, female and male
readers, and benvinguda in Dialogue 1, referring to Rachel, are
further examples of the use of the two adjective endings.
Exercise 1
Fill in the gaps with the personal articles elorlaor leave a blank
space as appropriate. We use sentences 1 and 2 as examples:
Example 1: Vostè és ___ senyor Woodhouse?
Answer: el.
Example 2: Hola, _____ senyora Roger, benvinguda a
Barcelona.
Answer: blank, no personal article is needed when
addressing a person directly.
1 Vostè és _____ senyor Woodhouse?
2 Hola, _____ senyora Roger, benvinguda a Barcelona.

Culture notes
Surnames
All Catalans have two family names ( cognoms : usually the father’s
surname ﬁrst and the mother’s surname second) often linked withi(= and) and given together when appropriate. In this case Elena’s
ﬁrst surname ( el primer cognom ) is Pérez and her second one ( el
segon cognom ) is Arnavat. In many situations, however, you will
hear only the ﬁrst surname being used.
Telephone area codes
All telephone numbers are preceded by the area code ( el codi terri-
torial ) which must be used no matter where the call is made from.
The area codes of the regions in Spain where Catalan is spoken are:
Alacant 96
Barcelona 93
Castelló 964Girona 972Illes Balears 971Lleida 973
Tarragona 977
València 96
Note that the article is used when giving a telephone number.

Numbers 1–10
0 zero 3 tres 6 sis 9 nou
1 u (un, una) 4 quatre 7 set 10 deu2 dos (dues) 5 cinc 8 vuit
You can listen to these numbers on the audio and practise for
yourself. Numbers up to 100 are in Unit 4.
U(un, una ),dos/dues
Uis used when number ‘one’ is on its own, as in telephone numbers.
Unis used with masculine nouns ( un senyor ) and una before femi-
nine ones ( una senyora ). When used in this way it is known as the
indeﬁnite article (= a/an, ‘a man’, ‘a woman’).
Number ‘two’ also has a masculine and feminine form: dos
senyors ,dues senyores , but you will also hear dos used by some
speakers for the feminine in colloquial language.
These two points apply to all the numbers ending in 1 or 2.
Numbers 3–10 do not have a separate form for the feminine.
Irregular verbs 1
The verb dirmeans ‘to say’, ‘to tell’ and ‘to call’. It is used as the
standard way of saying what your name is/what you are called. Inthe dialogue we hear how to say your name, by saying em dic . . .
(= I call myself →I am called) and how to ask someone else what
their name is in a formal way, by saying: com es diu (vostè)? (=
What are you called?).
The forms viu,visc are part of the verb viure (= to live) and té
is from tenir (= to have). Like serin Unit 1, these two verbs are
irregular . There is a list of irregular verbs in the Grammar refer-
ence at the end of the book that you may ﬁnd useful later on in the
course.
Most verbs in Catalan are regular in that they follow a ‘regular’
pattern in the ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘he’/‘she’, etc., set of forms. These patternsare referred to as conjugations . The ways in which such verbs are
conjugated will be explained gradually as you progress. Irregular10

=== PAGE 32 ===

verbs tend to be the ones most commonly used and the ﬁrst ones
to appear when colloquial everyday speech is being used.
The article 2: the deﬁnite article
The words eland laare also deﬁnite articles (= the). Their use is
similar to that of ‘the’ in English but there are some differences,such as the use of elbefore telephone numbers. The article is also
used with street names, but as in English, not with towns.Therefore, when considering the sentence visc a Girona, al carrer
Nord, número 7 (= I live in Girona at 7 North Street), a, which
means both ‘in’ and ‘on’, appears alone in visc a Girona , but as al
(the combination of a+el=al) in al carrer Nord .
You have probably observed another characteristic of the article.
If a singular noun begins with a vowel sound, both eland laare
written as l’, for example: l’hotel , which is masculine, and l’aigua
(= water), which is feminine. As indicated earlier, this is shown invocabulary lists with an (m.) or an (f.). Remember that the letter‘h’ is silent and therefore l’hotel is a word that begins with a vowel
sound.
The corresponding plural articles are els(masculine) and les
(feminine): els senyors ,les senyores .
Saying ‘thank you’
Gràcies was used earlier. Now you can say ‘thank you very much’
=moltes gràcies . Note that the spontaneous response to ‘thank you’
isde res , literally ‘for nothing’, that is: ‘don’t mention it’ or ‘that’s
all right’. There is less of a tendency to say gràcies in Catalan than
‘thank you’ in English. But when gràcies is used, it is much more
common to hear de res in Catalan than it would be to hear ‘don’t
mention it’ in English.

Language points
Tuand vostè 2
This conversation is more informal than the parallel situation in
Dialogue 1. Remember what has been said about the form of the
verb indicating person and number. Vostè is implied in com es diu? ,
while tuis implied in com et dius? Compare also té telèfon? with
tens telèfon? Similarly, jois not needed with em dic . . . , meaning 
‘I am called’.
The verb tenir ‘to have’
In the two previous dialogues we have heard tinc,tens and té, the
three singular parts of the present tense of tenir . The full conjuga-
tion is:
Singular (jo) tinc I have
(tu) tens you have (familiar)
(vostè/ell/ella) té you have (formal), 
he/she has
Plural (nosaltres) tenim we have
(vosaltres) teniu you have (familiar)

Asking questions 1
It is easy to ask a question in Catalan, as no change in word order
or other complications are involved. The statement tens telèfon
(= you have a telephone), with the rising intonation that is heardon the audio, becomes the question tens telèfon? (= do you have a
telephone?). Similarly, the intonation in the statement vostè és la
senyora Garcia (= you are senyora Garcia) is different from the
question vostè és la senyora Garcia? (= are you senyora Garcia?).
Adjectives 2
Remembering that the Catalan adjective always agrees with its
noun, note here the feminine forms irlandesa and benvinguda and
that -ashows the feminine singular agreement. The feminine plural
appears in moltes , as in moltes gràcies , with the characteristic -es
ending. The basic model for the adjective can be illustrated withmolt (= much; plural ‘many’):
Masculine Feminine
Singular molt molta
Plural molts moltes
Consider:
Menorca té molts monuments prehistòrics.
Tarragona té molta inﬂuència romana.
However, molt (= very) is often heard as an adverb, ‘intensifying’
another word, as in molt bé (= very well) or molt confortable
(= very comfortable) or molt intel·ligent (= very intelligent), in
which case its ending does not change.

Language points
Useful expressions
Note the standard question com estàs? (= how are you?) and some
typical positive replies: bé(= well, ﬁne), molt bé (= very well), anar
fent (= not too bad, OK). If you are not well, say: malament (= not
well). A colloquial alternative to com estàs? isquè tal? This is often
combined with hola in the phrase hola, què tal? (= hi, how’s it
going?).
Parlar més a poc a poc (= to speak more slowly).
Gràcies, as well as meaning ‘thank you’, is the standard reply 
when accepting an offer and is thus sometimes the equivalent of‘please’.
The formula et presento is often used in introductions (for 
vostè , it would be li presento ). The literal meaning is ‘I present
[Rachel] to you’, but, as with so many colloquial expressions, there is no direct word-for-word correspondence between the twolanguages.20

=== PAGE 42 ===

Silent letters
If you listen carefully to the dialogue you will observe that an
ar fent is pronounced something like /na’fen/ on the recording, 
with the ﬁnal -rofanar and the -toffent silent. This is a standard
feature of the pronunciation of rand t(see Pronunciation guide).
An example you are already familiar with is molt (pronounced
/mol/).
Another case of a silent letter is the ﬁrst -r-ofprendre , pro-
nounced on the audio as /pendre/. Prendre alguna cosa illustrates
another characteristic of Catalan pronunciation. Words that end in a vowel in contact with words starting with a vowel are oftenpronounced together, especially unstressed aand ein contact 
with another vowel. On the tape we hear /pendralguna/. This is important not only for good pronunciation, as awareness of thischaracteristic should make comprehension of what you hear 
easier.
Finally, note és clar is pronounced approximately /skla/.
Regular verbs: ﬁrst conjugation
As was explained earlier, the majority of Catalan verbs are
‘regular’, that is to say they are conjugated according to regularpatterns and there are three main groups. By far the largest has an inﬁnitive ending in -ar(parlar ,presentar , etc.). The inﬁnitive is
the basic form of the verb, and this is the form you will ﬁnd i
n dictionaries. It is like the ‘to’ form in English (i.e. ‘to speak’, etc.). Verbs with an inﬁnitive ending in -arform the ﬁrst conjuga-
tion. The pattern of endings for the present tense of -arverbs is 
as follows:
Singular (jo) parlo I speak
(tu) parles you speak (familiar)
(vostè/ell/ella) parla you speak (formal), 
he/she speaks
Plural (nosaltres) parlem we speak
(vosaltres) parleu you speak (familiar)
(vostès/ells/elles) parlen you speak (formal), 
they speak1111

The verb voler ‘to want’
As mentioned earlier, many frequently used verbs, like voler , are
irregular. Voler is conjugated as follows:
Singular vull I want
vols you want (familiar)
vol you want (formal), he/she wants
Plural volem we want
voleu you want (familiar)
volen you want (formal), they want
Exercise 1

Useful expressions
Com es diu . . .? means ‘How does one say . . .?’ and is a useful
formula for building up your vocabulary. Simply ask: com es diu en
català ‘mouse’? (= what is the Catalan for ‘mouse’?)
As in English, the pronoun can be used alone, with the sense of
the verb implied, as in: i tu (què vols)? Jo (vull) un tallat .
Nouns 2: gender
As you know, all nouns are of either masculine or feminine gender
and the easiest way of identifying the gender of a noun is by lookingat the article that precedes it, or by the (m.) or (f.) that follows itin dictionaries. Gender is a very important characteristic of thelanguage because it also affects the form of accompanying wordssuch as adjectives, possessives, pronouns, etc.
You may be pleased to know that patterns can also be observed
in this area of grammar, and you will ﬁnd it useful to look out forthem. The ending of the singular noun often gives a clue as to the
gender:
1 Words ending in -aare normally feminine (e.g. la sorpresa ,la
rosa,la persona ,la discoteca ).
2 Other vowel endings tend to be masculine (e.g. el metro ,el meló ,
el vi,el taxi ,el notari ,el cafè ,l’oncle ).
3 Words ending in a consonant are more likely to be masculine
than feminine (e.g. el cognom ,el telèfon ,el futbol ,el Parlament ,
el túnel ).
4 Remember that there are exceptions to our very general
guidelines. Some of these have to be learnt individually (like la
lletin the previous dialogue). Others can be seen as belonging to
established patterns that are very useful to know. The main onesare as follows:
Masculine Feminine
Words ending in -ma are Words ending in -ió,-tatand
normally masculine. -tud are normally feminine.

Culture note
Like other Mediterranean peoples, many Catalans are fond of their
coffee. The basic drink is un cafè , a small, strong espresso .Un tallat
is an espresso with a small amount of (usually warm) milk. Un cafè
amb llet is a full white coffee made with hot milk, a staple break-
fast drink alongside una pasta (= a pastry, frequently a croissant).
Un (cafè) americà is a coffee made with a lot of water as well as
some milk. On hot days un cafè amb gel (coffee poured over ice
cubes) or un granitzat de cafè (coffee in crushed ice) are refreshing
alternatives. Un carajillo (also known as un cigaló ) is made by
adding a generous dash of spirit, usually brandy, to a single coffee.
With other drinks, people often order a small snack known as
una tapa . The verb picar is used to refer to this custom of taking
una tapa or a variety of tapes to complement a drink.
Language points
Pronunciation
Doncs (= ‘then’/‘well’, or even ‘in this case’) is a very commonly
heard Catalan word used to ﬁll pauses in conversation, often, as30

=== PAGE 52 ===

here, between question and answer. Note also how it is pronounced
/dons/ and that the pronunciation of vullis /bui/. Finally, pay special
attention to the word liaison in the sentence però vull saber el nom ,
pronounced as /bui sabel nom/.
Asking questions 2
In this dialogue you also hear an example of the two most common
ways of asking questions. One is by using question words like 
què vols? (= what do you want?), onviu? (= where do you live?),
as seen in Unit 2, and, in this unit (Dialogue 2 below), quant és?
(= how much is it?).
Another common way of asking questions is to change the into-
nation of a statement as we heard in Unit 2. This type of question
usually only requires a yes/no answer. Examples in this dialogue arevols un carajillo? and i per picar? Without a rising intonation the
same words in the same order would mean ‘you want a carajillo ’
and ‘and for a snack’.
Nouns 3: plurals
The basic formation of plurals is with a ﬁnal -s. Many masculine
forms are written with just this ﬁnal -s. The frequent feminine
ending -abecomes -esfor the plural. In central standard speech the
vowel sound does not change between the singular and the plural.
So the ﬁnal vowel sound of singular oliva ,patata , etc. is identical to
that of plural olives ,patates , etc.
The indeﬁnite article 2
The plural form of the indeﬁnite article is unsfor the masculine and
unes for the feminine. In practice the plural article tends not to be
used: calamars ,patates fregides ,olives , as in the dialogue. When it
does appear it reinforces the meaning of ‘some’ or ‘a few’, as whenRachel replies saying unes olives .1111

Culture note
The currency now in use is the euro .Pessetes are still sometimes
referred to, particularly with large amounts, as in house prices. Notehow euros are expressed by stating the number of euros and cents
(cèntims ) together. When you hear two ﬁgures, the ﬁrst stands for
the number of euros, and the second for cents. So you will hear:dos cinquanta ordos amb cinquanta . You will also hear dos euros
cinquanta and dos euros amb cinquanta for even greater clarity.
Note also that the division between euros and cèntims is expressed
in writing with a comma and not with a point. This is important tobear in mind as, particularly with larger amounts, this detail canlead to confusion.34

Els bars són un aspecte molt important de la vida mediterrània i de
la vida catalana. Moltes persones passen més d’una hora al dia al
bar. És un centre social on es formen i desenvolupen les relacions
personals i professionals. Un eslògan publicitari diu que el nom dela ciutat de Barcelona conté els ingredients principals de la vida
barcelonina: BAR – CEL – ONA. ‘Bar’ és evident, ‘cel’ es refereix a
l’atmosfera (celestial) i ‘ona’ són les ondulacions que provoca elmoviment del mar. Molt apropiat.

Useful expressions
With hi ha . . .? you can ask where something is and give the
answer. Notice how Rachel uses a rising intonation to ask the ques-tion hi ha telèfon?
We have heard dirin the expressions com et dius? ;em dic . . . ;
com es diu en català? Here it has its basic meaning ‘to say’, ‘to tell’
inper dir que estic bé (= to say that I am well).
Telefona is the command form of the verb telefonar , meaning
‘do phone’ or simply ‘phone’.
Dona is used to reinforce what is being said, addressed, as here,
to a woman. The masculine equivalent home! (= man!) occurs more
often, and is heard even when talking with a woman: és clar, home!
(= of course); sí, home, sí (= yes, deﬁnitely).
The present tense of estar ‘to be’
Estic is the ‘I’ form of the present of the irregular verb estar (= to
be, to feel, to stay). We have already heard com estàs? , the standard
way of asking ‘how are you?’. The reply was molt bé without a verb
form because the verb was understood ( estic molt bé ).1111

The two verbs for ‘to be’ :serand estar 1
Here we come across the two verbs that are used in Catalan to
express what in English would be expressed with ‘to be’. Estic in
the dialogue represents one of the main uses of estar : asking what
‘state’ someone is in. There are also many examples of the use of
ser, which is the verb used to express identity or origin, as in sóc la
Sara ,d’on ets? Sóc de Nova York , or as in the dialogue, to express
inherent characteristics. For example: és de monedes ;ets molt
amable ;la família és la família .
Possessive adjectives
References to members of the family are often accompanied by the
possessive. At this point it is useful to note two important charac-
teristics of its behaviour:
1 The possessive is used with the corresponding article ( LA meva
germana ,ELS meus pares ).
2 The possessive, as any other adjective, agrees with the noun to
which it refers and has to be used with the appropriate ending(la meVA germana ,els meuS pares ). Consider the table below:
Masculine Feminine
my el meu la meva
your el teu la teva
his/her (your: vostè ) el seu la seva
our el nostre la nostra
your el vostre la vostra
their (your: vostès ) el seu la seva
Notes:
1 The masculine el nostre and el vostre and feminine la nostra and la vostra are
not distinguished in pronunciation.
2 They are normally used with the article.40

=== PAGE 62 ===

If more than one object is possessed you will need to use the 
plural form, made by simply adding an -sto the end (e.g. els meus ,
els teus , etc. in the masculine) and by replacing abyes(e.g. les
meves ,les teves , etc. in the feminine). Consider the following
sentences:
1El Felip i la seva germana són d’Andorra 
(= Felip and his sister are from Andorra).
2La Laura i la seva germana són d’Andorra 
(= Laura and her sister are from Andorra).
3El senyor i la senyora Garcia i la seva ﬁlla són d’Andorra 
(= senyor and senyora Garcia and their daughter are from
Andorra).
In all three cases la seva agrees with the feminine noun qualiﬁed
(germana and ﬁlla) unlike in English which needs ‘his’, ‘her’ and
‘their’ respectively.
Adjectives 3: making comparisons
És més fàcil contains an implied comparison: és més fàcil telefonar
amb el meu mòbil que des d’un telèfon públic (= it is easier to
phone with my mobile than from a public phone). Comparison ofadjectives in Catalan is straightforward. It is simply a case of putting
més before the appropriate form of the adjective in question. For
example: la meva germana és més amable que el meu germà (= my
sister is kinder than my brother). Consider how the second elementof comparison is introduced by que (= than). Similarly, menys
(= less) is complemented with que to express that one element is
less than another. For example: el Felip és menys militant que el
teu germà (= Philip is less militant than your brother). To say they 
are ‘as much . . . as’, tan . . . com is used. Consider: el Felip és tan
militant com el teu germà .
Superlatives
The superlative, corresponding to ‘the most . . .’, is formed by
adding the article to the comparative més followed by de(= the
most . . . of). Consider: el meu germà és el més simpàtic de la família
(= my brother is the nicest in the family).1111

Another important form of the adjective is formed by adding the
ending -íssim /-íssima . This is known as a sufﬁx , an ending that can
be attached to nouns and adjectives to add a nuance. This sufﬁxserves to intensify the force of an adjective and is equivalent to‘very’, ‘most’, ‘really’, according to context. It is often used to addintensity when giving opinions: el teu pare és amabilíssim (= your
father is really friendly); l’escultura de la teva mare és bellíssima
(= the sculpture of your mother is very beautiful indeed).

Text 1 
Hola. Em dic Andreu. Visc a Barcelona. Et presento la meva
família. Aquest és el Pere, és el meu germà. Som sis germans. Tincdues germanes i tres germans. El Pere és el més petit. Aquesta és
la meva germana gran, la Isabel. Avui és el vint-i-cinc aniversari de
la boda dels pares, les bodes de plata dels nostres pares.
Text 2 
–Qui és el senyor d’aquella foto?–El senyor d’aquella foto en blanc i negre és el meu avi.
Malauradament, l’àvia ja no és amb nosaltres. L’avi viu sol al poble,
a Mequinença, a la Franja d’Aragó. Bueno, sol no viu, viu amb elseu gos, el Misto, que li fa companyia.
Text 3 
–Pau, tens germans?–No, no tinc germans; sóc ﬁll únic. Però tinc molts cosins i això
compensa una mica. Mira, aquests dos són cosins meus.

Culture note
The ﬁve pictures on page 48 illustrate how from being a predomi-
nantly Catholic society, reﬂected in si Déu vol and in sis germans ,
although there has been a tendency towards smaller families and towards a more multicultural and multiethnic society. Text 2,which refers to the grandfather, shows the strong connection thatmany people who live in cities still have with the country. When
talking about the family, el poble usually refers to the village or
small town where one of the older members of the family comesfrom originally. In this case the village (Mequinença) is in theFranja d’Aragó , the strip of Aragon bordering Catalonia where
Catalan is spoken.50

=== PAGE 72 ===

El Poble Sec is a popular and colourful working-class district of
Barcelona.
Language points
Castilian words used in Catalan
There are very well-established Spanish (Castilian) words which are
used frequently in colloquial Catalan. We have already seen cara-
jillo. In describing the photos we also hear bueno ,guapo ,tio, all
with the characteristic Spanish ending in -o, pronounced -uin
Catalan because it is an unstressed -o. Of the three, the one that is
most easily replaced by a Catalan word is bueno , where often the
Catalan béis heard. Tio (feminine tia) means literally ‘uncle’
(‘auntie’) but it is colloquially used to mean ‘guy’, ‘bloke’, etc. (orfemale equivalent), in Spanish as well as in Catalan.
Nouns 4: plural patterns
We have seen that the standard pattern to form the plural is to add-sto the masculine and -esto the feminine.
Singular Plural
Masculine Feminine Masculine Feminine
el pare la germana els pares les germanes
l’avi l’amiga els avis les amigues
Most nouns ending in a stressed vowel add -nsto make the plural.
For example:
el germà els germans
el cosí els cosins
el català els catalans
la televisió les televisions
Masculine nouns
Masculine nouns that would be impossible or difﬁcult to pronounceif you just added -sto form the plural tend to add -osinstead
(pronounced /us/). For example, masculine singular words endingin-s,-ç,-x, or with clusters of consonants like - rs,-sc,-xt, form the
plural as follows:1111

el text els textosel complex els complexosel vers (= verse) els versos
l’anglès els anglesos
The demonstratives
The demonstratives (‘this’ and ‘that’) are used to indicate where
people or things are in relation to us. By now you will be familiarwith the need to change the ending of adjectives to agree with thenoun. Here is the pattern of endings:
Singular Plural
Masculine Feminine Masculine Feminine
this aquest aquesta these aquests aquestes
that aquell aquella those aquells aquelles
Note that aquest is pronounced /aket/, and aquests /akets/. In the
feminine singular and plural, however, the /s/ is pronounced.
Exercise 1
This exercise practises terms for the members of the family and also
the possessive adjectives which we saw in the previous unit.

Culture note
La faixa is a long stretch of cloth which is tied around the waist for
support. Traditionally this was worn by pagesos . Nowadays it is still
used by castellers .Castells (literally: ‘castles’) consist of teams of
men and women who stand on each other’s shoulders in an effort tobuild and then safely dismantle the highest human tower, usuallyseven, eight or even nine human storeys high. The design and heightof a castell depends mainly on the number of castellers who form
the base. The province of Tarragona is famous for its groups, espe-cially els Xiquets de Valls , but nowadays there are castle-building
groups all over Catalonia, and they hold trobades (= meetings) to
celebrate patron saints’ days and other special festivities.
Language points
Pronunciation
A reminder on the pronunciation of -ix- inaixò and faixa .
Remember that ixis one letter, the Catalan equivalent of the English
/sh/. So faixa is pronounced /fasha/ and això /asho/. (See the section
on digraphs in the Pronunciation guide.) The same is true of -ny- as
inCatalunya orany. The plural of anyis roughly pronounced /ansh/
because of the difﬁculty presented by this cluster of consonants.When you hear them on the audio, see if you can distinguish thesewords clearly.
Weak pronouns 1
Em preguntes (= you ask me) and t’envio (= I send you) in Text 6
and li fa companyia (= is company for him/keeps his company) in
Text 2 provide examples of a verb with a weak object pronoun. Theyare called weak because they are unstressed and pronounced as part
of the verb they accompany. They are usually placed immediately1111

before or after the verb. They are placed before most verb forms,
but are normally placed after the verb with the inﬁnitive and
command forms. Most forms change according to whether the ﬁrst
or last letter of the verb (whichever they come into contact with) isa consonant or a vowel.
At this stage you may want to concentrate on recognising their
presence and be aware of their approximate meaning. In time youwill become conﬁdent in their use. The Grammar referencecontains tables with further information and the dialogues incor-porate many examples of their use. Here is some basic advice to get
you into the habit of recognising the singular forms:
1 An /m/ sound immediately before or after the verb is the form
corresponding to ‘me’ in English. There are four possibilities: m’,
em,-me,’m. Consider: em dic Rosa ;telefona’m ,sisplau .
2 A /t/ sound immediately before or after the verb is the form
corresponding to ‘you’ in English (the tshowing its link to the
subject pronoun tu). There are four possibilities: t’,et,-te,’t.
Consider: t’envio la foto de la Clàudia ;et presento la Mercè .
3 An /l/ sound immediately before or after the verb is the form
corresponding to ‘him’, ‘her’ or ‘you’ (= vostè ). The possibilities
are: li,el,la,l’,-lo,-la,’l. Consider: vols telefonar-la? ;vull
enviar-li la foto de la Claùdia .
Further examples
Sound Before verb: After verb:
/m/ m’escolta em presento vol donar-me parla’m
/t/ t’escolto et parlen vol agafar-te presenta’t
/l/ l’escolten li diuen vull escoltar-lo estudia’l
el/la miren volem entendre-la
Asking questions 3
There are several examples in this section of the type of questionswhich require a question word:56

=== PAGE 78 ===

1Quants . . .? Albert mentions Clàudia’s age saying: té vint-i-tres
anys (= she is twenty-three years old). The way to ask someone’s
age is: quants anys tens /té?; literally: ‘how many years do you
have?’ The standard answer would be: tinc vint-i-tres anys .
Quant ,quanta ,quants ,quantes are question words used to ask
‘how much . . .?’, or ‘how many . . .?’. As adjectives, they agreewith the noun, so quants anys té? ;quantes ﬁlles té? (= how many
daughters do you have?).
2Quan (= when), is another important question word, as in the
sentence: quan comença el programa? (= when does the pro-
gramme start?). It should not be confused with quant , although
they are pronounced the same. As an adverb, quan only has one
form, unlike the adjective quant .
3Quin . . .? Another set of adjectives used to ask questions is:
quin ,quina ,quins ,quines meaning ‘which (one) . . .?’ or ‘what 
. . .?’, as in quina és la Clàudia a la foto? (literally: ‘which
is
Clàudia in the photo?’ implying, ‘of the several girls in the photo,which one is Clàudia?’). Quin would also be used to ask for the
colour of something, the standard question being: de quin color
és... ? (literally: ‘of which
colour is . . .?’).

Perdoni is the formal/polite equivalent of perdona , both translating
‘excuse me’.
Com ha dit? is a common way of asking politely for something
to be repeated, literally: ‘what have you said?’ (= what did yousay?). Pot repetir, sisplau? , or pot repetir-ho, sisplau? , which we
have come across earlier, would be alternatives. We have also heard
repeteixo in audio exercises, which means literally ‘I repeat’.
The article 4: contractions with 
prepositions
This dialogue contains another example of how a(= in/at) combines
with the article elto form al(AL ﬁnal d’aquest carrer ). Similarly
de(= of/from) with elforms del:on és la plaça DEL Sol? This has
to do with the running together of vowel sounds, and explains whyin the feminine a la and de la remain separate. The other common
preposition that contracts is per+el=pel.
Tuand vostè 3
This type of conversation with a stranger is usually conducted with
the polite form of address, using vostè . However, young people or
people of the same age would normally use tu, and many people
believe that tuis gaining ground over the use of vostè . Remember
that the vostè form is used with the verb in the third person and
that the word vostè itself is very often left out, as in sap on és . . .?
More examples: (vostè) parla bé el català ;on viu (vostè)?

The two verbs serand estar ‘to be’ 2
We have heard how seris used to express identity (as in sóc el
Martin ), origin (as in sóc anglès ) and inherent characteristics (as in
és de plàstic ). In this dialogue we observe another important use of
ser: to express position, and it is heard with this meaning
throughout the rest of this unit in the question on és . . .? (= where
is . . .?) and the appropriate replies.
Estar was used earlier to ask and explain how someone is/feels
(com estàs? ;estic bé ), a state that may change. It should be noted
that estar is often also used to express position and on està . . .?
instead of on és . . .? is another way of asking where a place is. As
indicated in the Introduction, we focus on the Catalan spoken incentral Catalonia and we have pointed out that there are variationsin the way the language is spoken in other areas. The use of estar
is one such variation. For example, Catalan speakers in Valenciawill always use estar to express position.

The gender of numbers
The hundreds, and numbers ending in one and two, have a mascu-
line and a feminine form. Other numbers have the same form forboth genders. Consider: dues-centes ,tres-centes ,quatre-centes ,
cinc-centes lliures esterlines (= £200, £400, £500, etc.) because la
lliura is a feminine word (but note cinc-cents euros , because l’euro
is masculine).

Useful expressions
Ho sento (molt). The homeans ‘it’, so when you say sorry in
Catalan you are literally saying ‘I feel it’.
Inés fàcil de trobar we see how some expressions take a prepo-
sition. In English this phrase corresponds with ‘it is easy to . . .’ or‘is it easy to . . .?’ if a question. Two further examples: és fàcil de
fer(= it’s easy to do); és fàcil d’anar al restaurant Barcino (= it’s
easy to go to restaurant Barcino), etc. Note that in Catalan a prepo-
sition can only be followed by an inﬁnitive, while in English theoption ‘going to Restaurant Barcino is easy’ exists.
The command form 1
Escolti like perdoni is a command form. Both have the character-
istic -iending which is used to make polite ( vostè ) requests. It is a
very useful ending when giving directions or listening to othersgiving directions. In earlier units we heard the equivalent in the lessformal tuform: escolta and perdona . In this context, other verbs
are frequently heard, for example:
vagi (from anar = to go) as in:
Vagi ﬁns al ﬁnal del carrer, i és a l’esquerra
(= Go to the end of the street and it is on the left);
agaﬁ (from agafar = to take, to catch) as in: 
Agaﬁ el primer carrer a la dreta
(= take the ﬁrst street on the right);
giri(from girar = to turn) as in: 
Al ﬁnal del carrer, giri a l’esquerra
(= turn left at the end of the street).
Prengui (from prendre = to take), which appeared earlier in the
context of having drinks, is also used in directions; like anar , it is
irregular. For example: 
Prengui el primer carrer a la dreta .68

=== PAGE 90 ===

The command form can be used with most verbs. Consider: parli
més a poc a poc, sisplau .
Ordinal numbers
The ordinal numbers (ﬁrst, second, etc.) up to tenth, which you can
listen to on the audio, are as follows:
1r primer 1a primera

Culture note
L’Eixample
The street plan below shows a section of the Eixample , an area of
Barcelona built mainly in the second half of the nineteenth century,which contains most of the city’s modernist buildings. Noted for itsgrid system of streets, the Eixample was built on the empty landbetween what was then Barcelona and the surrounding villages ofGràcia, Sants, Sarrià, etc. To a great extent these areas of Barcelonacontinue to foster their own quite distinctive character inside thelarge conurbation. The main arteries of the Eixample are el passeig
(= promenade) de Gràcia and l’avinguda (= avenue) Diagonal . As
its name suggests, this avenue crosses the Eixample diagonally.1111

Language points
Useful expressions
Què fas? is a simple present tense but in English would often be
translated as ‘what are you doing?’, showing us that the English andCatalan present tenses do not correspond exactly.
Fins means ‘until/up to’ with regard to both time and space. 
In this dialogue it is used in combination with ara(= now) to form
the expression ﬁns ara , which is the standard way of saying ‘see 
you soon’.
Giving directions
Because of the design of the Eixample and whole areas of otherCatalan cities, when giving directions it is normal to give the nameof the street and the two intersecting streets. The woman in the dialogue says Visc al carrer Mallorca 175, entre Casanova i
Muntaner , literally ‘I live on Mallorca Street, between Casanova 
and Muntaner’. Note that carrer can be left out. Note also that 
the preposition dewhich appears in the street plan is usually
omitted.
Giving your address
Most people live in blocks of apartments. The way of saying the
address involves saying the street, the door number, the ﬂoor and
the apartment door number. For example:
Enric Canals
C/ Quintana 28, 4t, 3a17300 Blanes
Enric lives in Quintana Street ( c/=carrer ), at number 28, on the
fourth ﬂoor ( el pis ), and his is the third door ( la porta ) on that
landing. His postal code ( el codi postal ) is 17300, in the seaside town
of Blanes. So, in the dialogue, Elisenda lives on the second ﬂoor ofher block, door number 1.74

=== PAGE 96 ===

Regular verbs: the present of the second
and third conjugations
New verbs continue to appear in the dialogues. Many, like agafar ,
are regular and will follow the model introduced earlier with parlar .
We have also heard some irregular verbs and you are probably
becoming aware of some emerging patterns which are common to
most verbs and tenses:
The following forms end in the following letter
Singular (jo) –
(tu) -s(vostè/ell/ella) –
Plural (nosaltres) -m
(vosaltres) -u
(vostès/ells/elles) -n
A good way of mastering the verb forms is to look for existing
patterns. You could start by comparing the endings of regular ﬁrst
conjugation verbs (inﬁnitive in -ar) with the endings of regular
second conjugation ones (inﬁnitive in -reor-er) and the third conju-
gation (inﬁnitive in -ir). Regular verbs of the second and third
conjugation are relatively few in number; you will hear examples insome of the dialogues. Also, Unit 15 will expand on the basicpatterns which are:
First Second Third 
conjugation conjugation conjugation
parlar perdre (= to lose) dormir (= to sleep)
1parl-o perd-o dorm-o

3parl-a perd dorm
4parl-em perd-em dorm-im
5parl-eu perd-eu dorm-iu
6parl-en perd-en dorm-en
Once you are familiar with the endings, all you need to do is to add
them to the stem. The stem is the inﬁnitive minus the -ar,-er/-re,
-irending.1111

Useful expressions
Per+ inﬁnitive means ‘in order to’, as in per anar . . . ‘to go to . . .’.
Tornar a means to do something (in this case preguntar ) again.
No cal is a very expressive way of saying ‘it is not necessary’. The
phrase no és necessari also exists, but it is not very frequently used.
It can also be used in the positive: cal agafar el primer carrer a la
dreta (= you need to take the ﬁrst street on the right).
If the address given is on a corner it is very easy to express: visc
a la cantonada de Mallorca i Muntaner . Or even: visc a Mallorca78


=== PAGE 100 ===

amb Muntaner . The plans produced by the architect Ildefons Cerdà
(1815–76), original designer of the Eixample, incorporated corners
that were chamfered to overlook the junctions and squares. As aresult of this design, each corner ( cantonada ) contains a number of
addresses. Giving directions to a taxi driver can also be very easy,simply: a Mallorca amb Muntaner, sisplau?
Weak pronouns 2: the pronoun of 
location hi
We have already seen hiin the phrase hi ha (= there is). Like ho
(= it, that), here seen with torni-ho a preguntar (literally, ‘ask (that)
again’), hialso makes an important contribution to the Catalan
language. Himeans ‘there’ referring back to a place already
mentioned: pot anar-hi a peu (= you can go there on foot) instead
of repeating pot anar al carrer Mallorca, entre Casanova i
Muntaner, a peu .
Com s’hi va? takes advantage of the ﬂexibility and brevity which
hioffers and combines it with another characteristic pronoun: 
es(considered later in more detail). The pronoun es(= one/oneself)
takes the form s’when followed by a vowel: the his silent, there-
fore hibegins with a vowel sound. So the English equivalent to com
s’hi va? is ‘how does one get there?’.
Prepositions
These dialogues involving directions are peppered with preposi-
tions. Prepositions usually establish a relationship between words
(‘in’, ‘at’, ‘on’, ‘by’, ‘with’, ‘from’, ‘of’, ‘for’, etc.). The prepositionmost frequently used here is abecause it means both ‘in’/‘at’ (posi-
tion): a l’esquerra ;a la cantonada ; and ‘to’/‘towards’ (direction): per
anar al carrer Mallorca, sisplau . Other important prepositions for
giving directions are de‘of’ and entre ‘between’: quina part del
carrer Mallorca? ;entre Casanova i Muntaner . Also, ﬁns a ‘until’:
ﬁns a la cantonada . Another preposition, des de , meaning ‘from’, is
used in Exercise 5 below, where there are also several uses of thepreposition per meaning ‘through’ and ‘in order to’. (A list of
common prepositions is included in the Language builder.)1111

2 Which district was built during the industrial revolution?
3 Which district is recommended for its social life?
4 In which part of Barcelona is the cathedral situated?
5 According to the text, around which public spaces does most of
the social life in the district of Gràcia take place?
Al segle XIX Barcelona és una ciutat molt petita: és només la part
on ara són els barris del Raval iCiutat Vella . Una secció important
deCiutat Vella és el Barri Gòtic , que és el barri preferit de molts
turistes i visitants, i té ediﬁcis històrics molt importants, per
exemple, la Catedral o el Saló del Tinell. A ﬁnals del segle XIX, la
construcció de l ’Eixample és el resultat de la Revolució Industrial i
conté els ediﬁcis de molts arquitectes famosos com, per exemple,
Domènech i Montaner, Puig i Cadafalch i el més famós de tots,
Antoni Gaudí. L ’Eixample connecta Barcelona amb altres poblacions
que ara són barris de Barcelona, per exemple, el popular barri de
Gràcia , on hi ha un ambient molt agradable amb una gran
concentració de bars, restaurants i espais públics. Una de les
característiques principals d’aquest barri és que la vida social es
concentra a les places, per exemple, la plaça del Sol, la plaça del
Diamant, la plaça Rius i Taulet, etc.

Culture note
La Rambla
La Rambla is the world-famous boulevard that links the centre of
Barcelona with the sea. It is celebrated for its cafés, shops, ﬂowerstalls, restaurants and above all as a focal point for locals andtourists alike. It comprises several sections: la Rambla dels Estudis ,
la Rambla de les Flors ,la Rambla dels Caputxins and la Rambla
de Santa Mònica . This explains the use of the plural, les Rambles ,
which is also often used (‘las Ramblas’ in Spanish). A stroll downthe Ramblas offers a variety of experiences, two of which arereferred to in the next dialogue: being entertained by street84

As in previous units, you may wish to turn to the Language builder
as you work through in order to complement points discussed.
The present tense: fer‘to do’/
‘to make’
The verb feris an often used irregular verb. It appears here in the
inﬁnitive. In the next dialogue it appears in the present tense, whichis as follows:
faig,fas,fa,fem,feu,fan
Asking and telling the time 1: 
the hours
The basic formula for asking and telling the time is, as we hear in
this dialogue: quina hora és? Són les tres (= what time is it? It is
three o’clock). Note that hora is feminine and therefore the femi-
nine article is used here because it refers to the feminine plural 
leshores . For the same reason, ‘it is two o’clock’ is són les dues ,
the feminine form of dos. In the case of ‘it is one o’clock’ = és la
una, the verb is not sónbut the singular és.
Hiused for emphasis
Notice how hiis used in a la Rambla hipots fer de tot , referring
back to a la Rambla for greater emphasis. This is a particular
feature of the spoken language.86

Useful expressions
The last two lines of the dialogue, when Núria realises her sister is
one of the members of the mime group, have an idiomatic ﬂavourwith several colloquial expressions: Segur que no? (= (Are you)
sure (that you do) not?). Òndia is an exclamation expressing admi-
ration or surprise.
Però si . . . does not translate literally as ‘but if’ . . ., which is the
meaning of the two words. Instead the combination is used with two meanings:88

=== PAGE 110 ===

1 To express mild protest, as we heard in Dialogue 1: però si no
marxem aviat (= but unless we get going soon). Or in a sentence
like: però si jo no he fet res! (= but I haven’t done anything!).
2 To express surprise, in sentences such as però si és la meva
germana! in this dialogue.
Adverbs ending in -ment ‘-ly’
There is quite a close correspondence between the way in which
English forms adverbs by adding ‘. . . ly’ and the Catalan system,which is to add -ment to the feminine form of the adjective. In the
dialogue we hear tranquil·lament from tranquil·la , the feminine
form of tranquil . Other examples: ràpid →ràpida →ràpidament ,
exacte →exacta →exactament ,precís →precisa →precisament ,
etc.
Present tense: obrir ‘to open’ and tancar
‘to close’
Obrir and tancar illustrate important aspects of the way Catalan
verbs work. In Unit 2, we saw that most regular verbs end in -ar.
Tancar belongs to this group. In the spoken language this verb is
completely regular. However, there is a spelling change in the
written form:
tanco ,tanques ,tanca ,tanquem ,tanqueu ,tanquen
A few verbs behave like this; the spelling change (in this case cto
qu) is necessary in order to preserve the same ksound throughout
the conjugation of the verb. Obrir is an example of the verbs with
the inﬁnitive ending in -ir, the small group of verbs known as the
third conjugation, many of which have minor irregularities:
obro ,obres ,obre ,obrim ,obriu ,obren
Asking and telling the time 2: opening 
hours
Quin horari fan? is a good way of asking about opening hours.
Complementary questions are: a quina hora obren? (= at what time1111

do they open?) and a quina hora tanquen? (= at what time do they
close?). Note how the preposition aplays an important part in these
constructions, usually corresponding to the English ‘at’: obren a les
vuit;tanquen al migdia ;a la tarda obren a les quatre ; etc. Another
useful preposition is de, in expressions like les quatre de la tarda ;
les deu del matí . For the names given to the different parts of the
day, look at the Language builder at the end of this unit.

Language points
Useful expressions
Vinga is another example of the frequent use of exclamations and
interjections which are such an important feature of colloquialCatalan. They are often difﬁcult to translate. In this case it means‘that’s decided’, ‘agreed then’. It is often used to express encour-agement: ‘let’s do it then’. Sometimes it is even used as an informal
way of saying ‘goodbye’.92


=== PAGE 114 ===

D’acord is the standard way of expressing agreement. La Font
de Canaletes is a popular meeting point at the beginning of the
Ramblas in plaça Catalunya. Legend has it that visitors who drinkfrom the fountain will return to Barcelona.
In the previous dialogue we came across em sembla meaning
‘I think’/‘It seems to me’. We now hear it as a question: què et
sembla dimecres? (= what does Wednesday seem like to you?/What
(do you think) about Wednesday?).
The days of the week ( els dies de la 
setmana )
Refer to the Language builder at the end of this unit for the list.
Note that the article elis used to perform the function of ‘on’ in
English: el dilluns surto molt tard de la feina (= on Monday(s) I
leave work very late).
The present tense: sortir ‘to go out’
Sortir is used here with its two main meanings. In the ﬁrst question
it means ‘to go out’, whilst in the answer it is used to mean ‘to leave’/
‘to ﬁnish work’. It is also a third conjugation verb, like obrir , and its
endings are a good example of the endings characteristic of thisgroup:
surt -o sort -im
surt -s sort -iu
surt (no ending) surt -en
The spelling change (in this case sort tosurt) does not change the
way the different forms are pronounced: the stem is always /surt/ asyou can hear in the dialogue.
Asking and telling the time 3: counting 
in quarters
There are several ways of telling the time in Catalan. The simplest
way is the ‘international method’, simply stating the hour and theminutes. For example: són les deu vint-i-cinc ;són les onze quaranta .1111

When using this method, common for example with railway timeta-
bles, speakers sometimes link the hours and minutes with iand also
sometimes add the word minuts , for example: són les deu i vint-i-
cinc minuts .
If you ﬁnd any of the explanations below difﬁcult, it is useful to
know that you can always resort to this method. However, when itcomes to understanding others telling the time, you are going to
hear a variety of expressions which you should at least be able to
understand. There are two such expressions in this dialogue, whichuse the traditional way of telling the time, based on counting thequarters to the next hour.
Consider the following examples:
És un quart de deu = 9.15 (literally: one quarter of ten)
Són dos quarts de deu = 9.30 (literally: two quarters of ten)
Són tres quarts de deu = 9.45 (literally: three quarters of ten)
Exercise 4
Here is an opportunity to practise the mental arithmetic necessary
to count in quarters. Listen to the audio and write down the timesyou hear:

address is being used. If the familiar tuform of address were being
used, the speaker would say no t’entenc .
Asking and telling the time 4: alternative
ways
Liam’s problem in this exchange is that he is not used to the system
of counting in quarters, especially when, as is the case here, the
quarter is subdivided. The woman says: entre dos i tres quarts
(= between two and three quarters), and then adds: dos quarts i mig
de cinc (= two quarters and a half towards ﬁve (15 + 15 + 7.5) =
about 22/23 minutes to ﬁve).
Minor misunderstandings are not uncommon. It appears that
counting in quarters is easier for those who are used to looking atthe conventional clock dial. The traditional method probably orig-inated with the very approximate way the time used to be referred
to when time keeping was a more relaxed affair. The only way of
knowing the time when working in the ﬁelds and unable to see thechurch clock, or sundial, was to listen out for the bells striking thehour and quarter chimes.
Time past the hour
Telling the time past the hour is very easily expressed: simply addminutes to the hours with i. For example: són les cinc i deu .Són les
cinc i tres minuts .Són les cinc i vint .
When it comes to són les cinc i trenta (5.30), many speakers
prefer to say: són les cinc i mitja (mig,mitja = half). If using the
traditional method you can also add minutes to the quarters.Consider the following examples:
És un quart i cinc de set. (6.20)
Són tres quarts i cinc de set. (6.50)
Són dos quarts i deu de set. (6.40)
Mig is also used in the traditional way. See if you can make out the
meaning of the last sentence on the audio in Exercise 6.96

Time to the hour
Time to can be expressed in two different ways, using falten . . . per
or with menys . In the ﬁrst case falten replaces són/és . This can be
expressed in relation to the hours or to the quarters. Consider the
following examples:
Falten deu minuts per les onze. (10.50)
Falten cinc minuts per dos quarts de dues. (1.25)
Són dos quarts menys cinc de dues. (1.25)
Són les deu menys vint. (9.40)
The combination of falten . . . per with the counting in quarters is
the traditional way.

VINT-I-QUATRE HORES A LA RAMBLA
Hola! Com estàs? Em dic Teresa, i de cognom, Amador, sóc la
germana de la Núria, visc al carrer Ample, a dos minuts de laRambla. Tinc un grup de mim amb dos amics, el Joan i la Rosi.
Ell és de Lleida, una ciutat de l’interior de Catalunya, i ella és
argentina, de Mendoza. El grup va molt bé. Generalment
comencem a actuar a les onze del matí perquè és quan hi ha
més turistes i fem dues o tres hores. Anem a dinar a unrestaurant i després de dinar jo vaig a casa a descansar una
mica. Al vespre fem quatre o cinc hores, el clima és més
agradable i la gent és més interessant. A la nit, jo passejo
tranquil·lament per la Rambla, hi tinc molts amics i amigues i
sempre hi ha coses interessants per fer. Vaig a dormir a les
tres o les quatre de la matinada, però a la Rambla encara hi ha
animació. Em sembla que a la Rambla hi ha vida les vint-i-
quatre hores del dia. L’únic dia que no sóc a la Rambla és el
diumenge perquè vaig a casa de la meva mare. Ella no vol
venir a la Rambla: diu que és caòtica i molt estressant.
Una abraçada,
Teresa

Culture note
El Mercat de la Boqueria
There are over forty fresh food markets in Barcelona, one in every
barri , all in covered halls. The most spectacular is la Boqueria .
They are not only full of opportunities for the discerning shopper,
but they are also an ideal environment for the study of local
customs and social conventions. However, as in other major cities,supermarkets ( els supermercats ) and department stores ( els grans
magatzems ) are playing an increasingly important role. The general
term ( els)centres comercials covers most of the modern types of
shopping complexes.
Botiga is the general word for a traditional ‘shop’. It is often used
to name shops: la botiga de verdures (= the greengrocer’s), la botiga
de comestibles (= the grocer’s), la botiga de roba (= the clothes
shop), etc. The pastisseria sells mainly cakes, pastries, confectionery
and some bread. The main place to buy bread is the forn (or
‘bakery’ proper). Bread is still part of most people’s staple diet and,
because of its importance, the price is standardised across Spain.The main units are les barres de quart ,de mig ,de quilo (white stick
loaves of 250g, 500g and 1000g).1111

written forms which reﬂect the slight difference in intonation.
Adjectives 4
This dialogue involves descriptions, and so it is worth revising herethe importance of the adjective–noun agreement in Catalan. Pay
special attention to the way cara agrees with fruita (or Enriqueta),
and barates with coses . You are already familiar with how to form
plurals.
Exercise 1
Complete the following sentences with the appropriate form of the
adjectives in brackets. The ﬁrst one has been done for you.
1 La verduleria de l’Enriqueta és cara
(car).
2 La fruita del Ramon és _____ (barat).3 El restaurant que hi ha a la Boqueria és molt _____ (barat).4 La carnisseria i la peixateria del Mercat de Sant Antoni són

Culture note
Shopping etiquette
Catalans are less given to standing in queues than some other
nationalities. The normal procedure on entering a shop, if busy, is
to ask the other customers who was the last to come in, with thequestion qui és l’últim? (as illustrated in the next dialogue) or 
qui és l’última? as appropriate. In this way, you know when it will
be your turn. The shopkeeper, after serving one customer, will 
ask who the next to be served is, with the question qui és ara? 
(= who is it now?), as in the opening sentence of this dialogue.Large shops tend to replace this traditional system with the issue of numbers.
Language points
Useful expressions
Voldria is a polite alternative to vull and a common way of
expressing requests. When giving something to somebody, tingui is
a polite way of accompanying a gesture (it is the vostè form of the
command form of tenir ).
És igual , like tant és in the previous unit, is a way of saying ‘it
doesn’t matter’. Ja està bé means ‘that’s OK’.
Passar andfaltar , which we have seen in the previous unit in rela-
tion to time, are used here to indicate that the weight is either moreor less than requested.
Passa una mica de mig quilo means ‘it is just over half a kilo’.
Ara falta una mica means that ‘now it is a little bit under’.
Weak pronouns 3: the indirect object 
pronoun li
In ‘Weak pronouns 1’ you learnt that an /l/ sound immediately
before or after a verb is likely to be a third person pronoun. Li
means ‘to him’, ‘to her’ or ‘to you’ when using the vostè form, as
in this dialogue. Unlike other pronouns, its form never changes,
regardless of position. It is an indirect object pronoun, which means106

=== PAGE 128 ===

that the person it represents beneﬁts from the action of the verb.
Consider: li dono euros (= I give euros to you), where euros is the
direct object, the thing given, and ‘to you’ ( li) beneﬁts from the
action of the verb ‘to give’. So, què li poso? means ‘what do I
put/serve (to) you?’ This phrase is one of several ways shopkeepershave of initiating a conversation with a customer. In everydayspeech it would be equivalent to expressions like ‘can I help you?’
Another interesting pronoun used in this dialogue is enwhich
will be discussed in more detail in the next dialogue. Here thesentence en vull mig quilo means ‘I want half a kilo (of ﬁgs)’. So,
enreplaces the word ‘ﬁgs’.
The use of res
After each item is passed on to the customer, the shopkeeper asks:
alguna cosa més? (= anything else?), or simply: què més? , until the
customer runs out of items and says: res més (= nothing else). We
have heard researlier combined with deinde res meaning ‘for
nothing’ or ‘don’t mention it’ as the usual response to gràcies . Here
inres més it combines with més to mean ‘nothing more’ or ‘nothing
else’, again a standard response to indicate that the order iscomplete.
The basic meaning of resis ‘thing’ but it has come to be used
mainly in negative statements, for example: no,no vull res (= no, 
I don’t want anything) and in no res which means exactly ‘no thing’.
In some expressions, however, nois implied, as in res més when
pronounced as a reply, as in this dialogue. Pronounced as a ques-
tion, however, res més means ‘anything else?’ We see, therefore,
that the meaning of ‘thing’ is still preserved. Other examples are:vols res? (= do you want anything?); li falta res més? (= do you
need/lack anything else?).

Language points
Useful expressions
Quant val? is the standard way of asking the price of something.
Note that the verb will have to change if it refers to more than oneitem: quant val el paquet de cafè? butquant valen les ampolles de
llet? There are alternative ways of asking the price. For items that
have a price that changes regularly, as is often the case in a market
stall, it is frequent to hear a quant va/van . . .? (= how much is it/are
they going for?). For example: a quant va la sardina? ,a quant van
les pomes?
El de . . . is a construction that cannot be translated literally in
English. El de Menorca /el del Pirineu mean ‘the one from Menorca/
the one from the Pyrenees’.
Passi-ho bé is a formal way of saying adéu . Note that unlike
English speakers, who tend to say hello when passing people theyknow in the street, Catalan speakers will tend spontaneously to saygoodbye ( adéu orpassi-ho bé , and not hola ).
Weak pronouns 4: command forms with 
an indirect object pronoun
As you learnt in ‘Weak pronouns 1’, an /m/ sound immediately
before or after the verb is the form corresponding to ‘me’ inEnglish. Four possibilities ( m’,em,-me,’m) were mentioned. In this
dialogue we see ’mused as an indirect object pronoun in the phrase
posi’m , often used by a customer in shopping situations. This phrase
corresponds to the formality of using the vostè form and indicates
a polite request or command. Therefore, posi’m pernil means ‘could
I have some
ham’ (literally: ‘serve ham to me’, where we see that
‘ham’ is the direct object and ‘to me’ the indirect.1111

40
414211109

=== PAGE 131 ===

This short statement contains several grammatical points which
may be listed:
1Posi is a verb in the vostè command form.
2 In commands any pronouns are attached after the verb; ’mis the
object pronoun me in the form it takes when immediately
preceded by a vowel.
3 There is no single word equivalent to ‘some’ in Catalan when
asking for things like ‘some ham’ or ‘some cheese’.
Weak pronouns 5: the use of en
As you have observed earlier, hiis used in Catalan as an econom-
ical device to refer to a place already mentioned. There is another
weak pronoun – en– which works in a similar way. The difference
is that enrefers to things already mentioned, as we hear in the
dialogue:
HOME Posi’m pernil.
DEPENDENT Quant en vol?
HOME Vuit talls.
It contains the idea of ‘of it’ and does not translate easily into
English. The question quant en vol? means ‘How much do you
want?’ (literally: ‘How much of it (the ham) do you want?’).
In this dialogue we also hear how Mireia says: posi-me’n quatre-
cents grams .Enhere follows posi’m to produce what in speech is
clearly recognisable as /pòsimen/. This appears in the written
language as posi-me’n . When two weak pronouns are in contact, if
a change in the spelling is necessary, it is the second pronoun thatchanges form. Therefore, according to this spelling convention, en
is reduced to ’n.
Contrasting the direct and indirect 
objects
We have referred several times to indirect and direct objects, a
distinction which is very useful in Catalan when you make yourchoice of pronouns. In the language point above we saw a sentencein which the distinction was clear: ‘serve ham to me’. As explainedearlier: the direct object has the action performed on it; the 110

=== PAGE 132 ===

indirect object receives the beneﬁt. Consider further examples
involving pronouns. First with an indirect function in em regala
(= he/she gives me (a present, for example)), and m’agrada
(= (something) is pleasing to me); and second as a direct object: em
mira (= he/she looks at me), m’estima (= he/she loves me).
Exercise 3
Decide if the underlined words in the sentences below are the direct
or indirect object.
1 El Joan et compra una càmera digital .
2 La Maria compra un cotxe per la seva mare .
3U s portarem a Valls en cotxe.
4M ’agrada la música nigeriana.
5 No els visito sovint.
6 L’Enric em regala una tele .
7L i compro una bicicleta .
Contrasting que . . .? and què . . .?
As we have seen earlier, Que . . .? is frequently used to introduce
simple questions. Note the difference of pronunciation and meaningwith Què . . .? The contrast is clearly shown in the dialogue Què
més? (= What else?) and Que té formatge de cabra? (= Do you
have any goat’s cheese?).

Culture notes
Pa amb tomàquet
In his guide to Barcelona, Miles Turner writes under the heading
pa amb tomàquet : ‘the essence of Catalonia: ﬁshermen have it 
for breakfast, housewives eat it mid-morning returning from a boutof shopping in the mercat with a loaf of bread in hand, and a 
bag of ripe tomatoes bursting with juice and ﬂavour. Tapas bars 
serve sophisticated versions of it topped with strips of anchovies,
capers, artichoke hearts and translucent slivers of mountain ham’.(Paupers’ Barcelona , London, 1992). Originally a way of recycling
dried-up bread, it is a very simple recipe. The basic ingredients are French-style bread, ripe ﬂavourful tomatoes, olive oil and salt(oli d’oliva i sal ). The tomato is cut in half and rubbed against the
bread, then oil and salt are added. As indicated in the quote, it is
usually served with a variety of delicatessen-type foods.
Language points
Expressing likes and dislikes 1
1Agradar is the verb most frequently used to express likes and
dislikes. It does not correspond exactly to the English ‘to like’;its essential meaning is ‘to please’/‘to be agreeable’.116

=== PAGE 138 ===

2 Because agradar means ‘to please’, its form will vary according
to whether what is liked is singular or plural:
M’agrada la paella (= paella pleases me/I like paella).
M’agraden les roses (= roses please me/I like roses).
This point is also illustrated in the dialogue. Consider the two
sentences:
El (formatge) de Menorca m’agrada 
(= Menorcan cheese pleases me/I like Menorcan cheese).
M’agraden (els tomàquets) verds 
(= Green tomatoes please me/I like green tomatoes).
3 To express dislike, simply add noto the beginning of the state-
ment. Examples: no m’agrada la carn (= I don’t like meat); 
no m’agraden les verdures (= I don’t like greens).
The use of enwith de
A small point in relation to the use of enis illustrated in the ﬁrst
response of the customer when asked how she wants the tomatoes.
She says: enté de molt madurs, per fer pa amb tomàquet? The
element in the sentence already represented by enis preceded by
de. Another example is when Vicent says vull pernil i formatge and
the shop assistant responds: quant en vol,depernil?

Culture note
Valencian paella
Ifpa amb tomàquet has been referred to as ‘the essence of
Catalonia’, the same writer might have called rice ‘the essence of Valencia’. However, rice is an essential component of the gastro-nomic map of all the Catalan-speaking areas, and not just Valencia.
The best-known dish is paella . In Catalan la paella also means a
frying pan. In Valencia the large shallow pan in which paella is cooked is known as el paelló . Originally, paella was a creative
way of making good use of any ingredients available. In part, thisexplains why there are so many variations. The originality and
success of the dish stem from the way the rice is cooked: the rice is
added to the other ingredients in the pan and then the boiling wateris added and the rice is cooked so that it absorbs the ﬂavour of allthe ingredients in the pan.
As a regular customer ( bona clienta ), Mireia is on ﬁrst name
terms with Teresa. This explains the use of tu, and is reﬂected in
the verb endings (e.g. posa’m instead of posi’m ).
Language points
The uses of ja
Jahas as its basic meaning ‘already’, for example in: ja parlo una
mica de català (= I already speak a little bit of Catalan). In a nega-
tive sentence it tends to mean ‘no longer’, ‘not any more’, as in this
dialogue: però ja no en tinc, de gambes (= but I no longer have any
prawns). However, it is often heard in a variety of expressionswhere a literal translation of jawould be difﬁcult, for example in
ja està, doncs in this dialogue. Doncs maintains its usual meaning
of ‘well, then’, and ja està , which normally means ‘it is ready’, could
be translated by ‘that’s it’, ‘that’s all I wanted’.
Expressing opinions with semblar 1
In earlier dialogues we have heard em sembla , with the two mean-
ings ‘I think’ and ‘it seems to me’. You have heard two further1111

examples in this dialogue. Semblar works like agradar ; consider the
following sentences:
1Què et sembla aquesta sípia? = literally, ‘How does this cuttle-
ﬁsh seem to you?’ but in everyday English we would say ‘Whatdo you think of this cuttleﬁsh?’
2Em sembla bona idea = literally, ‘It seems a good idea to me’ or
‘I think it’s a good idea’.
In such ‘back-to-front’ verbs ‘the thing’ determines the ending of
the verb and not the person. Consider:
3Què et semblen aquests musclos? (= How do these mussels seem
to you?/What do you think of these mussels?)
You might have noticed a difference between semblar and agradar .
Semblar is preceded by emand agradar bym’. This is because, as
indicated earlier, the pronoun em(= ‘to me’, the indirect object
pronoun) when followed by a consonant remains in the form em
but changes to m’when followed by a vowel. The same happens
with the second person pronoun et:t’agrada and et sembla . Notice
also the pronunciation of què et inquè et sembla and què et
semblen , which is pronounced /ket/ according to the ‘running
together of vowel sounds in contact’. In writing, què, like que, is
never shortened.
Exercise 2
Now exchange opinions about the food you have just eaten with your
friend Frederic:
F
REDERIC Què et sembla aquest arròs?
YOU Say: I like it . Ask: What do you think of the mussels?
FREDERIC Molt bons, m’agraden molt.
YOU Ask: What do you think of the cuttleﬁsh?
FREDERIC Excel·lent, és molt fresca.
YOU Say: I like this restaurant . Ask: What do you think of
the restaurant?
FREDERIC M’agrada. M’agrada molt. Però és una mica car. A tuquè et sembla?120

=== PAGE 142 ===

YOU Say: It does not seem expensive to me. It is reasonably
priced and it is very good .
FREDERIC I l’ambient t’agrada?
YOU Say: Yes, I like it a lot .
Dialogue 3 
In this extended dialogue, four friends from Sitges, Andreu, Montse,
Raisha and Blai, discuss going to the cinema in Barcelona.
• Answer the following comprehension questions:
1 How many screens does the new cinema have?
2 What does Blai think of this type of place?
3 What is Blai’s ﬁnal decision about going to the cinema?
4 What do the friends think of Blai?
5 What kind of ﬁlm have they seen?
6 What does Andreu think of the ﬁlm?7 Where is the director of the ﬁlm from?8 Why is Blai in the bar?
9 What do Montse and Raisha do in the end? Why?
ANDREU Què voleu fer aquest vespre? Passem el vespre a Sitges
o anem a Barcelona?
MONTSE Què us sembla si anem al cinema a Barcelona?
RAISHA A mi em sembla bé. Han obert un multisales prop de
l’autopista. Em sembla que té divuit o vint sales.
ANDREU A mi també. M’han dit que és força agradable i que hi
ha un bon ambient.
MONTSE Al Blai no li sembla bé, oi que no?
BLAI A mi tant me fa, però és que no m’agraden aquests
espais tan moderns i grans, no són gens acollidors, són
molt comercials. A més a més, penso que és mésimportant saber quines pel·lícules fan, no us sembla?
R
AISHA En fan divuit o vint. Sempre en fan una o dues debones.
B
LAI A mi m’és igual. Peró només fan pel·lícules comercials
i les trobo més aviat avorrides. És que avui ha estat un
dia difícil . . . ha estat un dia traumàtic, amb moltsproblemes a la feina. Estic molt cansat, molt cansat. Joprefereixo passar el vespre a casa tranquil·lament iveure què fan a la tele.1111

Later Andreu, Montse and Raisha discuss the ﬁlm:

ANDREU Molt divertida, a mi m’ha agradat força, i penso que
demostra que les pel·lícules comercials també poden
ser intel·ligents.
RAISHA És americana o anglesa?
MONTSE Em sembla que americana. És un d’aquests directorsjoves americans que treballen sempre a Nova York.Però, també pot ser anglès perquè hi ha molts directors
anglesos que treballen als Estats Units.

traumàtic, amb molts problemes a la feina. Estic moltcansat, molt cansat?’ Anem a parlar amb ell?
A
NDREU A mi no em fa res, però no sembla gaire content. Quèli passa?
Finally, the three cinemagoers speak to Blai:A
NDREU Blai, què hi fas aquí?
BLAI Prefereixo no donar explicacions. Voleu prendrealguna cosa?
A
NDREU Què voleu fer?
MONTSE Home, jo prefereixo anar cap a casa. Tu què vols fer,Raisha?

Language points
Useful expressions
This dialogue, dealing with opinions, impressions, etc., contains a
large number of adjectives ( agradable ,modern ,acollidors , etc.) and
various ways of qualifying them like no . . . gens and més aviat .
Exclamations are another device used here by the four friends
to express their feelings. Note that if the exclamation contains anoun it is preceded by quin/quina . . .! as in quina llàstima! (= what
a pity!). Another example: quin concert! (= what a concert!).
However, if an adjective is involved it is preceded by que . . .! As
in:que avorrit que és en Blai! (= how boring Blai is!) Another
example: que interessant! (= how interesting!)
Notice here two more expressions to indicate indifference: a mi
tant me fa and a mi m’és igual, both mean ‘it doesn’t matter to me’,
‘I don’t mind’, ‘it’s all the same to me’. In both cases a mi is used
for greater emphasis. They are frequently heard as simply tant me
fa,m’és igual , or even és igual , which, like tant és , you have already
heard.
The perfect tense 1
The speakers in this dialogue introduce us to a new tense, which is
underlined in the text. Like its English counterpart, the perfecttense in Catalan is formed using the present tense of the verb ‘tohave’ with the past participle of the verb:
Auxiliary haver Past participle: -arverbs
he parlat I have spoken
has parlat you have spoken
ha parlat he/she has spoken
hem parlat we have spoken
heu parlat you have spoken
han parlat they have spoken
Past participles end in -t. Most end in -at(-arverbs), -ut(-re/-er
verbs), -it(-irverbs). There are a few irregular ones, such as obert
(from obrir ), which you are already familiar with from shop opening
times.124

=== PAGE 146 ===

There are many similarities between the use of the English and
the Catalan perfect tense. However, there is one important differ-
ence: in Catalan, when referring to events that happened today , the
perfect tense is always used. This is explored in more detail in Unit
14. Consider the perfect tense forms that are heard in Dialogue 3:
han obert un multisales 
(= they’ve opened a multiplex/a multiplex has been opened).
m’han dit
(= they have told me/someone told me).
a tu què t’ha semblat la pel·lícula?
(= what did you think of the ﬁlm?)
a mi m’ha agradat força
(= I have liked it very much/I liked it very much).
ha estat un dia difícil . . . 
(= it has been a hard day).
ha dit 
(= he said/he has said).
Expressing opinions with semblar 2
An opinion can be expressed in a variety of ways. Semblar is used
in a wide range of statements, several of which are heard in the
dialogue. At one point, Blai uses one of the alternatives: the verb
pensar (= to think). The advantage of pensar is that it is easy to use
because it works very much like its English counterpart, althoughit is usually followed by que (= that): penso que és una situació
política molt difícil ; the disadvantage is that it has a more limited
use than semblar , which can also be used in this way followed by
que:em sembla que és una situació política molt difícil. Pensar
tends to be used in more formal situations to express opinions orideas held.
Semblar is very ﬂexible because it combines easily with other
elements to express meaning. The Language builder contains afuller range of expressions using semblar and agradar . First, con-
sider these examples using semblar .1111

1 With adverbs and adjectives
em sembla bé
= it seems ﬁne to me →I think it’s ﬁne
et sembla fàcil?
= does it seem easy to you? →do you think it’s easy?
li sembla interessant
= he/she ﬁnds it interesting
You may have noticed that the adverb bé(= well) becomes ben
when it precedes an adjective or past participle. In the dialogue wecome across ben fet (= well made). Another example: la pel·lícula
està ben dirigida (= the ﬁlm is well directed). The opposite is mal:
mal fet ,mal dirigida . Other commonly used adverbs are included
in the Language builder: força and molt for positive statements and
no . . . gens ,no . . . gaire for negative ones.
2 With question tags
Note also how in the dialogue the statement al Blai no li sembla bé
(= Blai doesn’t agree) is reinforced with the question tag oi que 
no? (= does he?). In mireu, oi que és en Blai? (= look, isn’t that
Blai?) we hear an example of how oi que . . .? is used at the begin-
ning of a sentence; this is a device used in rhetorical questions. The
uses of oiand oi que will be discussed in more detail in Units 13
and 15.
3 With pronouns
It is quite common for the person involved to be mentioned twicefor emphasis, either with a strong pronoun as in: a mi em sembla
bé(= it seems ﬁne to me), or with the name of the person: al Blai
no li sembla bé (= Blai doesn’t agree/think it is a good idea).
Note that the ﬁrst pronoun or the name of the person is preceded
bya(al/a la) .
In order to be conﬁdent in making sentences with semblar , you
need to be familiar with the appropriate indirect object pronouns.126

=== PAGE 148 ===

The table below shows in bold the ‘weak’ or unstressed pronouns
which always accompany semblar and the stressed pronouns
preceded by awhich are only used for additional emphasis:
Pronouns used with ‘semblar’

JANE Què és el berenar?
ENRIC El berenar és un àpat lleuger, és al voltant de les sis dela tarda. Poques persones grans berenen. Sobretotberenen els nens. Em sembla que els grans fan el
berenar més aviat com a excusa per sortir amb els amics
a prendre alguna cosa. Per exemple, a Barcelona hi hagent que va a una granja a prendre, no sé . . . potser,xocolata amb xurros, o un cafè amb una pasta o unaorxata. T’agrada l’orxata? Són molt diferents les hores

Culture note
El berenar
The words for meals ( l’esmorzar ,el dinar ,el berenar i el sopar )
have appeared earlier. Here Enric talks about meal times. El
berenar is a mid-afternoon snack mainly for children but also used
by adults as an excuse to socialise and share a drink. One traditionalsnack and a refreshing drink are introduced: xurros (= long, thin
sweet fritters) and orxata (= cold tiger nut milk). A granja can be
a very atmospheric place. Granja literally means ‘farm’, and it is the
name given in Barcelona to a café where traditional drinks andpâtisserie are on offer.
Language points
Useful expressions
Cap allà a andal voltant de both mean ‘at about’ in relation to time.
In contrast to a les deu en punt (= at ten o’clock precisely), these
phrases often mean a little later than the time stated. For example:la festa comença cap allà a les deu (= the party begins at about ten,
but nobody is expected until 10.30 or 11.00).
Diminutives
Incerveseta we hear a word we are acquainted with already
(cervesa ) and notice its different ending. In this case the feminine
diminutive sufﬁx -eta (-etfor masculine nouns) is used by Enric to
play down his habit of drinking ‘just a little beer’ around ten o’clockin the morning. Native speakers can be very creative with suchendings. It takes time for a non-native speaker to get them right,but it is useful to be able to recognise them. A masculine example
with this ending would be entrepanet or ‘little sandwich’.
Sometimes the ending is more unpredictable, as in cafetó (a little
coffee) and cafetonet (a tiny coffee). In reality, though, the amount
of coffee consumed may not change.1111

Verbs like prendre
The distinctive sounding prenc , in the phrase prenc un cafè , is the

Culture note
Catalan cuisine
This menu illustrates the type and variety of dishes usually on offer
in restaurants. Traditional cuisine incorporates mar i muntanya (=
sea and mountain) products: meats, sausages and game from inland
blended with seafood and ﬁsh from the coast, combined with freshvegetables and salads.
As well as wine, it is normal to have on the table a bottle 
of mineral water, either still ( sense gas ) or sparkling ( amb gas ). It
may be useful to learn what to say when going into a room where
there are people eating: bon proﬁt! (= enjoy your meal), and if
appropriate, the response igualment (= you too).
Romesco is one of several celebrated Catalan sauces (= salsa ).
The ingredients vary, but a typical recipe includes dried redpeppers, tomatoes, garlic and almonds. Another sauce is allioli
(often a kind of garlic mayonnaise but strictly speaking just oil and
garlic). As you know, allmeans garlic and olimeans oil. This
garnish is also well known in the French ailloli , one of many indi-
cations of the close cultural past shared by Catalonia and southernFrance.1111

Dialogue 3 
Sr. Sugranyes, a regular client, is asked to give his opinion on the
menu and the proprietors of Planelles’ restaurant.
• Consider how adjectives are used in descriptions, by answering
the following questions:
1 Give two reasons why Sr. Sugranyes likes this restaurant.
2 What words does he use to describe the wine?3 What words does he use to describe the proprietress?

opina del restaurant i del menú?138

SR. SUGRANYES A mi m’agrada perquè tenen plats tradicionals i
les quantitats són generoses. Em sembla que la
cuina catalana tradicional és molt saludable.L’únic plat que no m’agrada és l’amanida verdaperquè la trobo avorrida. Però el romesco quefan aquí és excel·lent, els macarrons sóngustosos, el lluç sempre és molt fresc, la botifarra
és casolana, el bistec el fan més aviat cru, com a
mi m’agrada i el vi de la casa és un vi agradablei refrescant. La propietària, la Maria, és moltsimpàtica i educada. El Pere, el propietàri, ésmés seriós, però també és molt educat i simpàtic.

Adjectives 3: ending patterns
The majority of adjectives follow the normal pattern with four
endings that we have seen with molt . In case of doubt you can iden-
tify an adjective in a dictionary because it is usually followed by theabbreviation adj. Consider: Il·legal adj.Illegal .
Singular Plural
Masculine Feminine Masculine Feminine
-a -s -es
molt molta molts moltesverd verda verds verdessimpàtic simpàtica simpàtics simpàtiques
In the spoken language the pattern is quite straightforward. In
writing there are a few spelling changes. Remember, for example,how there is a spelling change between molta and moltes (atoe),
but no sound change except for the additional /s/ sound. Similarly,
there is no change in sound between simpàtica and simpàtiques .
1 Adjectives with a different ending for the feminine:
Singular Plural
Masculine Feminine Masculine Feminine
c→g groc groga grocs grogues
u→v blau blava blaus blaves
t→d educat educada educats educades
2 Adjectives ending in a stressed vowel add an nto form the
feminine and plural forms:
Singular Plural
Masculine Feminine Masculine Feminine
americà americana americans americanes
bo bona bons bones140

=== PAGE 162 ===

3 There are adjectives that have a different masculine plural
ending. As with nouns, there are some adjectives that take the
ending -os:
Singular Plural
Masculine Feminine Masculine Feminineirlandès irlandesa irlandesos irlandesesanglès anglesa anglesos angleses
generós generosa generosos generoses
dolç dolça dolços dolçes
In this group, dolç means ‘sweet’. Note the pronunciation of -os
on the audio.
4 Some adjectives are the same in the masculine and feminine, and
consequently only have two forms: singular and plural. Most
adjectives with the following endings are of this type:
Singular Plural
Ending Masc./fem. Masc./fem.
-al original originals
-able amable amables-ant interessant interessants
-ent intel·ligent intel·ligents
-e jove joves
Jove means ‘young’ and, as is the case with many other adjec-
tives, it can also be used as a noun: els joves (= young people).
In writing there are quite a few exceptions to the -eending
group, for example in the dialogue we have heard negre which has
the feminine negra , but in speech they are pronounced the same.
Position of the adjective
Adjectives usually come after the noun they describe, as in la cuina
tradicional , even if they are linked by the verb ser, as is often the
case when describing things: la cuina és tradicional . However,
remember that we have already heard cases of adjectives that come
before the noun. Note especially that numerals, demonstratives(aquest etc.), possessives ( meu etc.), interrogatives ( quins ,quantes ,
etc.), quantiﬁers ( molt ,poc, etc.) tend to precede the noun: el
primer pis ,aquesta fruita ,el meu germà , etc.1111

The preterite tense 1: what happened 
yesterday
At the end of this dialogue Sr. Sugranyes introduces us to the way
of talking about things that happened before today . This is in fact
a very easy tense to use and to form, by placing vaig,vas,va, etc.
before any inﬁnitive. All that changes, and so all you have to learn,are the parts of this special auxiliary verb:
The preterite tense
vaig
vasva+ inﬁnitivevam
vau
van
Consider:
Va demanar el menú del dia
(= he asked for the set menu).
Em va agradar (= I liked it).
Vaig menjar molt (= I ate a lot).
Exercise 5
Looking at Dialogue 3, ﬁrst identify the adjectives. Then write them
in two columns, one with the adjectives that belong to the groupwith four endings and one with those belonging to the group withtwo endings.
Exercise 6
Form sentences with each of the items in column 1, the appropriate
form of the verb from column 2 and the corresponding adjective
with the appropriate ending from column 3.142

Text 1
Now read this text describing shops in Barcelona before completingExercises 8 and 9.
Les botigues de Barcelona
Les botigues són una de les atraccions principals de Barcelona.
Com diu el proverbi: ‘Barcelona és bona quan la bossa sona’. Les
botigues de moda més cares i exclusives són al passeig de Gràcia,al centre de la ciutat. Aquí hi ha els grans dissenyadors inter-
nacionals com Armani o Calvin Klein, i també els locals com Armand
Basi o Antonio Miró. Les millors botigues de roba per gent jove són
al Portal de l’Àngel. A Ciutat Vella és on hi ha botigues més
interessants, però sovint no és fàcil trobar-les, i cal caminar molt.En aquest barri els dissabtes hi ha mercats alternatius amb ofertesespecials de roba: d’importació, ètnica, de fabricació artesanal,retro-hip ,retro-chic ,cyber-punk , etc. Són botigues ideals per gent
amb criteris clars i ben deﬁnits.
Per un altre tipus de gent hi ha els centres comercials. El més
famós i clàssic de tots és El Corte Inglés, a la plaça Catalunya, peròel més soﬁsticat és l’Illa Diagonal, al ﬁnal de la Diagonal. Si vol unambient selecte i exclusiu vagi a les botigues de la part central dela Diagonal, aquí no hi ha sorpreses, anar-hi a comprar és una
experiència agradable i tranquil·la. Els mercats també venen roba,
és barata però generalment és poc cool i sovint la qualitat no és
gens bona.1111

Language points
Useful expressions
1Sóc el John . This is an important detail in a phone conversation.
In English he would say ‘It’s John’, whilst Catalan says ‘I amJohn’.
2Amb qui parlo? (= literally: ‘With whom am I talking?’ = ‘Who’s
calling, please?’)
3A on (= where). Onis often reinforced with the preposition a,
particularly when it is on its own.
4Estic a punt de . . . (= literally ‘I am on the point of . . .’ = ‘I am
about to . . .’)
5Què et sembla si quedem al Zurich? illustrates an important use
ofquedar , which is a verb with several meanings. In this context,
it provides a very useful way of making arrangements. It can be
used to arrange the place of meeting and also the time ofmeeting. In the dialogue Gabriel asks whether John would liketo meet later on in the day ( vols quedar més tard? ). John says:
sí, quedem a les onze . . . millor quarts de dotze . In this way he
conﬁrms Gabriel’s idea as to place and time, specifying that a
little later would be preferable.
The gerund ( -ntending)
This dialogue introduces the equivalent to the English ‘-ing’ ending
or gerund. As in English, the equivalent form in Catalan is verystraightforward:
Estar + -nt
Example: Estic
mirant la tele (= I am watching TV).
As has already been indicated, by far the largest group of Catalan
verbs end in -ar, and therefore their ‘-ing’ ending will be -ant.1111

=== PAGE 171 ===

But there are also some examples in the unit of -er/-re (second
conjugation) and -ir(third conjugation) verbs. In those cases the
ending of the verb will be in -ent and-intrespectively. For example:
què estàs fent ara? (= what are you doing now?) and estic sortint
de casa (= I am leaving the house).
Notice that in Catalan the present continuous form is used only
to describe actions or activities that are going on at the moment ofspeaking. If someone asks: què estàs fent? you can reply estic
mirant la tele or more frequently simply miro la tele : both are used
in Catalan where in English only the continuous form is possible.In case of doubt, choose the present tense instead, which in Catalancan always substitute the continuous form.

asks per què et lleves tan aviat? (= why do you get up so early?).
Many common or everyday activities are expressed by such a
combination (verb + pronoun) in which the verb is called reﬂexive ,
because the action is done ‘to oneself’, although this is not alwaysobvious. One example of such a verb, which you are familiar withalready is dir-se (= ‘to be called’; literally: ‘to call oneself’).
Reﬂexive verbs have a characteristic inﬁnitive ending. For
example: llevar-se ,dutxar-se ,rentar-se ,afaitar-se . Here is the full
form of dutxar-se :
Verb beginning with Verb beginning with 
a consonant a vowel
em dutxo m’estic dutxant
et dutxes t’estàs dutxantes dutxa s’està dutxant
ens dutxem ens estem dutxant
us dutxeu us esteu dutxantes dutxen s’estan dutxant
Notice also: em rento la cara (= I wash my (own) face) and es renta
les dents = (he cleans his (own) teeth) where use of the reﬂexive in
Catalan (in actions concerning parts of the body and personal
clothing) does the same job as the possessive pronoun in English.
Exercise 2

To have to . . .
As well as being used to form the perfect tense, haver is used to
express obligation. Haver de + inﬁnitive is equivalent to English ‘to
have to’.
he(orhaig)
hasha +de+ inﬁnitive
hem

Example: he d’anar al gimnàs a les vuit
The future tense 1
This unit introduces the future. This tense is straightforward to form
in all three conjugations, which take the same endings. It is simplya case of adding the appropriate ending to the inﬁnitive, as the tablebelow shows:
The future tense: passar
passar-é
passar-àspassar-àpassar-empassar-eu
passar-an154

=== PAGE 176 ===

There are very few irregular futures, but even those take the
same endings. In this unit you hear an example of a verb which is
slightly irregular, fer→faré,faràs , etc., which changes the stem but
the endings and even the pronunciation remain regular.
Exercise 4
Now listen to the questions on the audio and decide which is the
appropriate answer from the alternatives below:
a Sí, he de sortir ara. He d’anar al supermercat.
b He de treballar ﬁns tard. No acabaré ﬁns a dos quarts de vuit.
c He de treballar tot el dia. No puc sortir.
d Em sembla que va dir que ha de treballar.e Hem d’anar a una ﬁra industrial.

Language points
Useful expressions
En primer lloc (= in the ﬁrst place) is useful when making several
points: en segon lloc etc.
Expressing ‘how long ago’
Fa . . . anys is the standard way of expressing time ago . For example:
vostè fa més de vint anys que treballa amb nosaltres, oi que sí? 
(= you have been working for us for more than twenty years,haven’t you?). Consider: fa dos anys que visc a Lleida (= I’ve lived
in Lleida for two years). Unlike English, this expression uses thepresent tense (you may want to think about it as: ‘I’ve lived in
Lleida for two years and I still live there ’).
Expressions with cap
Cap basically means head (head of personnel = cap de personal )
but it has many other uses:
1 Preceded by noit means ‘none’, ‘not any’. Here no . . . cap forms
part of the idiomatic expression: no em fa cap gràcia (= I don’t
think it’s funny/a good idea). Consider: no em fa cap gràcia anar
al cinema (= I don’t feel like going to the cinema). Fer gràcia
means ‘to amuse’, so no li farà cap gràcia in the dialogue means
‘she won’t be at all amused’.
2 We have also seen cap in the phrase cap allà a used in time
phrases like cap allà a les deu . This can be said more simply as
cap a les deu (= at about ten).158

=== PAGE 180 ===

3Cap a is also the standard way of saying ‘towards’ as in vaig cap
a l’ajuntament (= I’m heading for the town hall).
Adjectives with adverbs: ben and massa
When semblar was discussed, força and molt were introduced to
intensify adjectives. In this dialogue we hear how ben is used with
a similar function. Ben is the form taken by bé(= well, very) when
it precedes an adjective. As in és ben fàcil (= it is very easy) and
ben fet (= well done) but ho fa molt bé (= he does it very well).
The adjective bo→bon (= good) before a masculine noun follows
a similar transformation: és un bon moment per estudiar (= it is a
good time to study) but és un cafè molt bo .
Massa (= too, too much) works in the same way before an
adjective: és una pel·lícula massa llarga . In this dialogue we hear it
used referring to a verb in treballa massa . Other adverbs are used
in the same way: treballa força (= he works quite a lot) and treballa
molt . Note therefore that adverbs normally precede adjectives but
follow verbs.
Question tags
Another characteristic of this type of conversation is the use of
‘tags’. The single word oiin Catalan covers the great variety 
of English questions commonly tagged on to the end of sentences
as a way of seeking agreement: ‘. . . do you?’, ‘. . . don’t you?’,‘doesn’t he . . .?’, ‘will you . . .?’, etc. For example: ja no treballes
al restaurant, oi? (= you don’t work in the restaurant any more, do
you?). In this dialogue we hear how the speaker, for greater
emphasis, uses oiin the phrase: oi que sí? , which is a stronger way
of seeking agreement: és una feina interessant, oi que sí? (= it’s an
interesting job, don’t you think?). In English you might say: ‘isn’tthat the case?’, ‘don’t you think?’, ‘wouldn’t you agree?’, etc.However, if the phrase is negative, oi que no? has to be used.
Consider the following statement: no t’agrada la televisió, oi que
no? (= you don’t like television, do you?). Or in the dialogue: vostè
no fa hores extres, oi que no? Note how, unlike English, in Catalan
if the main sentence is in the positive, the tag is in the positive, andif the main sentence is in the negative, the tag is in the negative.1111

Culture notes
The Euromed is a sleek modern train ( el tren ) that links Barcelona
to Valencia in just over three hours. A high-speed track is plannedthat will reduce this time signiﬁcantly and join the Spanish rail
system to the European high-speed network. The issue of connec-
tion with Barcelona and Europe is an important one: Valencia isSpain’s third city and the relationship between Valencia, Barcelonaand Madrid is reﬂected as much in transport as in politics. Forhistorical and political reasons some Valencians tend to look more
towards Barcelona, others more towards Madrid. The issue came
to a head over TV3 , the Catalan television channel, which for a time
Valencians were not allowed to see.
At the heart of les Falles celebrations are the giant-size satirical
and political papier-mâché sculptures ( els ninots ), which are built
on wooden frames and painted before being burnt as huge bonﬁres
(les fogueres ). There is one bonﬁre in each barri , where these
monstrous sculptures are on display for a few days before they areburnt. The ritual has been described as Europe’s ‘wildest Springfestival’ (Miles Roddis, Valencia & the Costa Blanca , Lonely Planet,
2002), but there is molta marxa in Valencia all the year round. 1111

El Miquelet is the cathedral’s bell tower, offering a panoramic view
of the city.
Language points
Useful expressions
Acabo d’arribar (= I have just arrived). Acabo de + inﬁnitive is the
standard way of saying ‘to have just done something’.
Passar-s’ho bé : note how the reﬂexive verb passar-se combines
with ho.
Que em prens el pèl? (= are you pulling my leg?). Because
prendre means ‘take’ and pèlmeans ‘hair’, this useful phrase liter-
ally means ‘are you taking my hair?’, which corresponds to English
‘are you pulling my leg?’. This idiomatic phrase is pronounced asfour syllables, not ﬁve. Remember that que em becomes /quem/ in
spoken language. Consider: /quem pren sel pel?/.
The perfect tense 2
As indicated earlier, the perfect tense is used to refer to the recentpast. Its basic function is to refer to actions that have taken placetoday or which refer to past actions still seen to be relevant to the

A sense of history
El Barri del Carme is the Gothic quarter around la plaça de la
Reina . At its heart is the eclectic cathedral, along with other signif-
icant buildings including a former Borgia palace ( el Palau de
Benicarló ) and the palace of the Generalitat , as well as many other
medieval and Renaissance features, including several towers like la
Torre de Santa Caterina .El Palau de la Generalitat has been the
seat of the Valencian regional government since the ﬁfteenth
century. The saint mentioned by Sr. Amorós is Francesc de Borja
(1510–72), great grandson of a Borgia pope. Note that ‘Borgia’ isthe Italian spelling of Borja , the Valencian family that rose to
prominence in ﬁfteenth-century Italy.
Language points
Useful expressions
I tant! is frequently used to express strong agreement.
Deixar de ploure (= to stop raining). Deixar de + inﬁnitive
means, by extension, ‘to stop doing something’: he deixat de fumar
(= I have stopped smoking/given up smoking). Deixar is another
verb with a range of meanings; perhaps the main one is ‘to leavesomething somewhere’. For example, ha deixat les claus sobre la
taula (= he has left the keys on the table).166

=== PAGE 188 ===

Note also the slightly different meaning of three verbs you
already know when they are used in relation to photography: fer,
sortir and quedar :
1 The use of ferin the phrase fer fotos (= to take pictures or
photos) means literally ‘to make’ photos.
2Sortir appears with two meanings. ‘Go out’ (when Sr. Rushdie
goes out) and ‘come out’, referring to the pictures he has taken.
3 We are introduced here to another use of quedar , this time refer-
ring to the outcome of the photographs, meaning ‘they havecome out’. The meaning of quedar here is similar to the meaning
ofsortir .
The perfect tense 3: irregular past 
participles
Some verbs do not simply add -at,-utor-itto form the past parti-
ciple. Dialogue 2 introduces some such irregular past participles.These are:
Inﬁnitive Past participle
fer(= to make) fet
veure (= to see) vist
ploure (= to rain) plogut
poder (= to be able) pogut
tenir (= to have, hold) tingut
Using the perfect tense of reﬂexive verbs
When using a reﬂexive verb like dutxar-se in the perfect tense,
notice how the reﬂexive pronoun contracts before the auxiliaryhaver :m’he dutxat ,t’has dutxat ,s’ha dutxat and s’han dutxat , but
ens hem and us heu dutxat . For more irregular verbs see the
Grammar reference.

Rushdie uses some new expressions in this dialogue: tot seguit and
al cap de + length of time ( al cap de mitja hora = after half an hour).
Al cap de offers particular ﬂexibility in combining with other
elements to express time nuances. Consider: Al cap d’una estona
(= after a while), al cap de poc (= after a short time), al cap de ben
poc (= after a very short time). The latter is a particularly good
example of the abundance of monosyllabic words that end in a
consonant in Catalan. You have recently seen an example of this in
the phrase que em prens el pèl? This feature, together with the
characteristic -ocending of poc, also gives the phrase al cap de ben
poc what some consider to be a distinctively Catalan sound.

International Book Day
St George is the patron saint of Catalonia. La diada de Sant Jordi ,
St George’s Day (23 April), is also el dia del llibre (Book Day), a
custom recently adopted by other countries. On this day, it is tradi-tional for men to give women a single red rose ( una rosa ) and for
women to give men books in return, but these gender roles have
never been set in stone. Big book stalls ( les parades ) are set out in
the streets and main squares, and booksellers offer a discount.Ferran Torrent is a leading contemporary Valencian writer.

The perfect tense 4: uses
This dialogue shows that the perfect tense has three main
applications:
1 The main use is to refer to things done today: m’he llevat a les
sis i he anat a la feina . This usage does not always coincide with
English usage, where one would usually say ‘I got up at six andwent to work’ and not ‘I have got up at six and I have gone towork’.1111

=== PAGE 191 ===

2 This dialogue also shows that the perfect tense can be used as in
English to refer to things in the past which are felt to be still rele-
vant to the moment of speaking: aquest any he llegit molt poc
(= this year I’ve read very little). Other examples: aquest estiu
no hem fet vacances (= we have not been on holiday this
summer); sempre han viscut al mateix carrer (= they have always
lived on the same street).
3 Examples in (2) illustrate reference to a past time with the
demonstrative aquest ,-a. When a sentence starts with an expres-
sion of time introduced with aquest ,-a, it is normal to use 
the perfect tense. For example: aquest any no hem fet vacances
(= this year we haven’t had a holiday). This is an area where we
must be particularly careful to avoid interference with English
usage. Consider: aquesta nit no he dormit bé (= last night I didn’t
sleep well); aquest cap de setmana no hem sortit de casa (= this
weekend we didn’t leave the house).

The generation gap
University can take a long time and young people often stay at
home up to the age of 30 and sometimes beyond. This is mainly dueto the difﬁculty of ﬁnding employment and housing.1111

The antiglobalisation movement has been popular among young
people in Catalonia for some time, with hundreds of thousands
attending demonstrations in Barcelona and elsewhere. The okupa
movement is loosely connected with the global squatter movementand the anarchist movement, which has deep roots in Catalonia,from before the time of the Spanish Civil War (1936–9). GeorgeOrwell wrote a personal account of this period in Homage to
Catalonia .
Language points
Useful expressions
Another idiom with fer:fer la carrera again alerts us to the ﬂexi-
bility of fer, here meaning: ‘to do a university degree course’.
Position of possessives
We have seen how the possessive is normally used before members
of the family: la meva germana . However, When referring to ‘my
home’ the standard phrase is casa meva ,casa teva , etc. The phrase
la meva casa is also grammatically correct, but it means ‘my house’
and not ‘my home’.
Abbreviated words
És (tot) això de . . . (= It’s (all) that stuff about) is a general way of
referring vaguely to something. In this case it introduces some
contemporary references to modern Catalan culture: la mani (short
form of la manifestació (= demonstration)) and l’okupa (m./f.) (=
squatter, a grafﬁti spelling from ocupar (= to occupy)) represent a
wider tendency of colloquial Catalan to produce short forms ofpopular words and non-conventional spellings. Many are closelyassociated with school and student culture. Common examples
include: la bici (from la bicicleta (= bicycle), la tele (televisió ),el
boli (from el bolígraf = ‘ballpoint pen’), el/la profe (from el/la
professor/a = ‘teacher’), la poli (from la policia = ‘police’), el cole
(from el col·legi = ‘school’), tranqui (often used to mean ‘calm
down’ in the phrase tranqui ,tranqui from tranquil = ‘calm’).172

=== PAGE 194 ===

Nouns ending in -ista
Antiglobalista provides an example of the -ista ending used in
words like artista ,optimista ,dentista (= dentist), etc. These words
do not change their ending when applied to men or women, so: el
dentista andla dentista . In the plural: els dentistes andles dentistes .
It is more common to hear the masculine plural, as this includesboth men and women, whereas the feminine plural is used only torefer to women.

15 La sobretaula
After dinner talk
In this unit you will learn about:
• Describing aspects of work and home life
• Agreeing and disagreeing
• Vocabulary of professions and work• Second and third conjugation verbs• Prepositions
• Conjunctions
La sobretaula refers to the practice of sitting ‘around the table’ after
a meal and engaging in conversation. The long lunch break is an established part of Mediterranean life. It is convenient,especially when it is hot, and some people still take a migdiada
(afternoon nap or siesta), particularly in rural areas.
The sobretaula tends to be particularly lengthy on dies de festa
(weekends, patron saints’ days and ofﬁcial celebrations). Thedialogues in this unit are examples of the types of sobretaula
conversation which can be rather serious (as in Dialogue 3),
although gossip and other socially bonding topics of discussion
ﬁgure prominently too.
Dialogue 1 
Blai, a chef, has just met Terenci, a former teacher, who now worksas a journalist in local radio. Terenci says how important it is in hisprofession to meet people.1111

Language points
Talking about work
Fer de is one of the many idiomatic uses of this verb; the expres-
sion means ‘to work as’, ‘to have a job as’. There can often be a
hint of it being a temporary, new or different job.
Note the difference between English and Catalan when saying
what your job is, with no indeﬁnite article: la meva cunyada és infer-
mera (= my sister-in-law is a nurse).
In work-related conversation the reﬂexive verb dedicar-se (a)
is often heard, meaning ‘to be occupied/employed (as)’; literally: ‘to
dedicate (oneself) to’. Note how dedicar-se a is followed by an
abstract noun: em dedico al periodisme , as in the dialogue, or em
dedico a l’ensenyament (= I am in teaching), whereas other expres-
sions like fer de are used with the name of the professional in the
ﬁeld: faig de botiguer (= I’m working as a shopkeeper); sóc empre-
sari (= I’m a businessman).
Sitting down to talk: prepositions and 
conjunctions
As we move into situations in which people are sitting together and
having longer conversations, sentences naturally become more
complex. This is noticeable in the use of prepositions, and above all in the increased use of conjunctions, which allow the speaker to connect thoughts and phrases together with greater ﬂuency. Asindicated in Unit 8, prepositions usually establish a relationship
between words (‘in’, ‘at’, ‘on’, ‘by’, ‘with’, ‘from’, ‘of’, ‘for’, etc.). If
prepositions establish connections within a sentence, conjunctionsdo a similar job between sentences (‘and’, ‘or’, ‘but’, ‘then’, ‘that’,‘because’, etc.). You will ﬁnd that including prepositions andconjunctions in your speech will help you use more of the vocabu-lary and the verbs you have learnt. For lists of frequently used
prepositions and conjunctions, see the Grammar reference.1111

=== PAGE 199 ===

Preposition a
So far, we have discussed prepositions as they occurred in the
dialogues, and the most frequently used ones appeared in the
Language builder at the end of Unit 8. This dialogue shows us more
about the preposition a, which, as you know, can be used both in
expressions of direction (to/towards), for example: vaig a la platja
(= I’m going to the beach), and of position (at/in). Consider thephrase: treballo a la ràdio (= I work in radio). What we also observe
intreballo en una ràdio local is that ais normally replaced by enin
expressions of position when followed by un(a) ,algun(a) and
aquest(a) which begin with vowels. So: sóc a la fàbrica (= I am at
the factory), but treballo en una fàbrica . Two further points in rela-
tion to prepositions:
1 Remember that a few verbs, like dedicar-se (a) , are almost
always followed by a preposition: em dedico a la gestió
d’empreses (= I work in management). You already know anar
a, used again in this dialogue: anar als restaurants . Other verbs
can be used with or without a preposition, and in this case the
verb’s meaning can change slightly, as is the case with fer (de) .
Examples: faig molta feina (= I do a lot of work); faig de pagès
(= I’m working as a farm worker).
2 Sometimes you will see per a forper, especially in written texts.
The ais usually lost in the spoken language.
Conjunctions
Note how the following conjunctions establish a relationship
between sentences (‘and’ [ i], ‘or’ [ o], ‘but’ [ però ], ‘then’ [ doncs ],
‘that’ [ que], ‘because’ [ perquè ]). These conjunctions have all ﬁgured
prominently in previous dialogues and texts. In this dialogue,Terenci’s pauses and hesitations are punctuated in his speech withthe colloquial insistence upon the conjunction però .
No sols . . . sinó que (també) . . . = ‘not only . . . but (also)’. This
is an example of a more complex conjunction, of the type more
usually found in written texts or in formal speech.178

=== PAGE 200 ===

The present tense: the second 
conjugation
The dialogue uses three verbs: perdre (= to lose), saber (= to know)
andtémer (= to fear) that belong to the small group of mainly irreg-
ular verbs that form the second conjugation (see Unit 8). As youknow, this conjugation is formed by verbs with an inﬁnitive endingin in -reor-er. In Unit 12, we also mentioned a small sub-group
ending in -endre which has the ﬁrst person ending in -enc (prendre ,
aprendre ,vendre ,entendre , etc.). The main thing to observe with
other members of this group is that they often do not have an -o
ending in the ﬁrst person, and instead end in a consonant sound,for example: conèixer (= to be acquainted with, to know people)
whose ﬁrst person is conec . Remember that the most frequently
used irregular verbs, like saber , appear in a table in the Grammar
reference. Observe that the most obvious irregularity is often in theﬁrst person, as in veure →veig, and in the next dialogue creure
(= to believe) →crec.

Patricia’s ﬁnal point relates to family arrangements and the social
security system. What she says is valid for many Mediterraneansocieties, which are often seen to fail their young people. It is said
that Catalans tend to depend more on their immediate and
extended family for welfare support and career opportunities thantheir counterparts in northern Europe.
Language points
Useful expressions
The underlined expressions in the dialogue are particularly useful
in discussions.
1 You have already heard the expression és que . This is very useful
to introduce an explanation, and it means something like ‘the
fact is that . . .’. An extension of this is: i com és que . . .? meaning
‘and how is it that . . .?’
2 Observe two further examples of how oi que . . .? is used:
a To introduce questions for which a positive answer is
expected, often seeking conﬁrmation of something alreadyknown: oi que tens un cotxe nou? (= haven’t you got a new
car?).182

=== PAGE 204 ===

b As a gentle way of making a request (often with the future
tense): oi que m’acompanyaràs al cine? (= you will come to
the cinema with me, won’t you?).
3Estic d’acord and no estic d’acord are ways of expressing agree-
ment and disagreement. The expressions hi estic d’acord and no
hi estic d’acord are also frequently heard. We also hear jo crec
que, which is a strong way of introducing an opinion, meaning:
‘I believe that’. Compare creure (= to believe) with pensar (= to
think) and semblar (= to seem).
4A vegades (= sometimes). Una vegada ,dues vegades ,tres
vegades , etc. is the standard way of saying ‘once’, ‘twice’, ‘three
times’. Moltes vegades (= many times).
The third conjugation -eix- verbs: preferir
‘to prefer’
This dialogue introduces more third conjugation verbs ( -irending).
In Unit 8 we considered the conjugation of the regular verbs. Here,we ﬁnd another type of third conjugation verb, to which compartir
(‘to share’), coincidir (‘to coincide’), decidir (‘to decide’) and patir
(‘to suffer/to worry’) belong. This type of third conjugation verbdiffers from the rest because it introduces an -eix- sound, sometimes
called an increment , before the usual endings in all persons except
the ﬁrst and second person plural. You are already familiar with themost commonly used member of this verb group in the ﬁrst person:prefereixo , from preferir :
prefereixo
prefereixesprefereixpreferimpreferiuprefereixen
The -eix- verbs are wholly regular, unlike many non-incrementing
-irverbs, which tend to have some irregularities.1111

Culture notes
The dialogue reﬂects some of the linguistic and political tensions
surrounding the use of Catalan. Sr. Sugranyes says that his neigh-
bour has difﬁculty in understanding the Majorcan variety ofCatalan. He might be referring mainly to the pronunciation of some
of the vowel sounds, some of which are different in Majorcan.There are also some differences in verb endings and vocabulary. Healso refers to his own perception of the threat represented by theuse of Castilian (Spanish) by young people.
It is not rare to hear aspects of language being discussed at sobre-
taula . This is an area on which a wide range of opinions are held
and conversations can be lengthy. Sr. Toda mentions les circum-
stàncies which refer to the social and political situation that exists
in the different areas where Catalan is spoken.
La Vanguardia is the main Castilian-language broadsheet pub-
lished in Barcelona. The most prominent Catalan-language news-paper is Avui (www.avui.es). There is also a very successful paper
published in both languages called El Periódico de Catalunya (www.
elperiodico.es). El Diari de Barcelona is only published online
(www.diaridebarcelona.com). Also of interest are the independentEl Punt (www.vilaweb.com) and TV3 online (www.tvcatalunya.
com). A number of Catalan radio stations can also be found on 
the net.
Language points
Tan and tant
In this dialogue we have heard again the use of tan, meaning ‘so’/
‘as’, as in no està tan malament (= it isn’t so bad); it is an adverb
and therefore its ending will never change. In Dialogue 1, we heard186

=== PAGE 208 ===

the use of tant, inanar tant als restaurants no és bo per l’úlcera ,
which has the same pronunciation and means ‘so much’. Tant can
be used as an adjective and therefore has feminine and pluralendings: tant,tanta ,tants ,tantes and can mean ‘so much’ and ‘so
many’. For example: tantes sorpreses no són bones per la salut (=
so many surprises are not good for your health).
The use of pas
Inno és pas tan fàcil ser jove avui dia (= it is not at all easy to be
young these days) we hear another example of tan, but there is also
an example of a construction that is not uncommon in Catalan: no
...  p a s . This is an idiomatic way of adding emphasis to a negative
statement. Another example is: no m’agrada pas treballar .
The use of prou
The phrase ja n’hi ha prou combines four elements, all of which we
have met before apart from prou , which is introduced here for the
ﬁrst time. The basic meaning of the statement is ‘that’s enough’.
The individual elements that make up this expression are: ja
meaning ‘already’, n’(en) meaning ‘of it’ and hi ha meaning ‘there
is’.Prou on its own is a simple and effective way of expressing
‘enough’.
The use of estar
Note that the ﬁrst exchanges in this dialogue contain several exam-
ples of how estar is used to express the idea of ‘to be’ to refer to
states likely to change or the result of change:
TODA Home, no sé què dir-li. Jo no hi estic d’acord. Si tenim
en compte les circumstàncies, no està tan malament.
SUGRANYES Vostè és un optimista.
TODA Sí, jo sempre penso que el vas està mig ple.
Ésis used, however, in vostè és un optimista , because it expresses
an inherent characteristic.1111

London SW1 1XX
Sra. Isabel Muntaner,
Fòrum Periodístic Català,
C/Sicília, 239, 2n, 1a.
Londres, 6 de setembre de 2005Distingida senyora,
Li escric aquesta carta perquè vostè em va demanar
informació sobre la meva experiència laboral. Vaig néixer
a Bulgària i vaig estudiar periodisme a la universitat deSòﬁa. Vaig començar a treballar de periodista en un
important diari búlgar ( Trud ), l’any 1975. Cinc anys
després, vaig passar a ser la corresponsal a Londres. 
A Anglaterra vaig conèixer el meu marit, també
periodista. És ﬁll de catalans, els seus pares van anar aviure a Anglaterra al ﬁnal de la Guerra Civil espanyola,
l’any 1939, i l’any passat ell va començar a treballar amb
una empresa ﬁnancera a Barcelona. Vam començar a
passar temporades llargues a Barcelona i ﬁnalment vam
decidir quedar-nos a viure aquí. És per això que li vaigescriure el mes passat per demanar feina i li agraeixo molt
la seva amable resposta.
Atentament,
Victòria Rilska
P.D. Adjunt li envio el meu currículum.

Culture note
There are no major differences between letter writing in English
and Catalan. One minor difference is the way the date is writtenwith the name of the place followed by a comma and the day, month(with no capital letter) and the year. It can be placed above orbelow the main body of the letter. P.D. is used as an equivalent to
‘P.S.’, which is also an alternative. Distingit ,-ida and Atentament
are formal ways of saying ‘Dear’ and ‘Yours sincerely’ in a letter.We have already seen estimat ,-daand una abraçada for beginning
and ending more informal letters to friends. Another common wayof ending a letter is Ben cordialment (= Yours sincerely).
Language points
The preterite tense 2: the auxiliary 
form of anar
When the preterite was introduced in Unit 12, we learnt that it is
formed by placing an auxiliary before the inﬁnitive. The forms of192

=== PAGE 214 ===

the auxiliary: vaig,vas,va,vam,vau,van, coincide in part with the
present tense of anar (vaig,vas,va,anem ,aneu ,van). Consider the
difference, then, between vaig menjar (= I ate) and vaig a menjar
(= I am going to eat), where we see an instance of the preterite inthe ﬁrst example, and the verb anar followed by a+ inﬁnitive in the
second example. Consider two further examples:
1Va treballar en una empresa americana (= he worked in an
American company) and: va a treballar a les sis (= he goes to
work at six o’clock).
2Vam treballar per un diari japonès (= we worked for a Japanese
newspaper) and anem a treballar a les sis (= we go to work at
six o’clock).
Note that the ﬁrst phrase of each pair contains the auxiliary used
to form the preterite, and that the second phrase of each paircontains the present tense of the verb anar proper.
Uses of the preterite
1 As you know, the preterite refers to single actions completed in
the past before today . For example: van comprar entrepans (= they
bought sandwiches); va sol·licitar una feina de cambrer en un
restaurant molt bo (= he applied for a job as a waiter in a very good
restaurant).
2 Events viewed as over and done with and completed (or periods
of one’s life looked back upon as single events, as we see in theletter) are also referred to in the preterite: vaig estudiar periodisme
a la universitat de Sòﬁa (= I studied journalism at Soﬁa university);
a Anglaterra vaig conèixer la meva dona (= I met my wife in
England).
3 The preterite is also used when describing sequences of events.
For example: va telefonar a la secretària i li va preguntar el nom
del director de recursos humans, després va escriure una carta persol·licitar la feina d’administratiu (= he phoned the secretary and
asked for the name of the human resources manager, then he wrotea letter to apply for a job in administration).1111

Dialogue 1 
Now listen to this short extract of an interview between Sra. Muntaner
and Victòria Rilska about what she used to do when she was in hernative Bulgaria.
S
RA. M UNTANER Què feia vostè quan era a Bulgària?
VICTO`RIA De jove jo era atleta, corria els vuit-cents
metres. Prometia molt. Fins i tot els meus pares
pensaven que seria una atleta professional. Per
això jo treballava a la secció d’esports del diari.
Era responsable del tennis i l’atletisme. M’envi -
aven a tots els campionats internacionals i m’ho
passava molt bé, però estava sempre molt
estressada i guanyava molt poc. Per això vam
anar a Londres. Allà guanyàvem molts diners,
però era una vida molt frenètica. Ara volem una
vida més sedentària.

Language point
Formation of the imperfect
The imperfect tense has two sets of endings.
First conjugation -arverbs add the following endings to the stem:
-ava,-aves ,-ava,-àvem ,-àveu ,-aven . For example, the imperfect
ofparlar is:parlava ,parlaves ,parlava ,parlàvem ,parlàveu ,
parlaven .1111

40
414211195

=== PAGE 217 ===

Second and third conjugation verbs form the imperfect with: -ia,
-ies,-ia,-íem ,-íeu,-ien. There are few irregularities if one considers
that the stem used to form the imperfect is the same as the ﬁrstperson plural of the present. So: prendre →pren-em →prenia ;
beure →bev-em →bevia , etc. For example, the imperfect tense of
perdre is:perdia ,perdies ,perdia ,perdíem ,perdíeu ,perdien .
The main exception is ser, which has a completely different form:
era,eres,era,érem ,éreu ,eren . Another exception is fer, which
retains fe-as the stem and adds regular endings, but with the stress
on the stem fe-and not on the ending -i
aas in preni a:feia,feies,
feia,fèiem,fèieu,feien. There is a small group of verbs that follows
this model, like dir(deia etc.) and creure (creia etc.).
Uses of the imperfect
The imperfect refers to past events extended in time. It has two
main uses:196


=== PAGE 218 ===

1 To express something that was going on for a period of time, as
in the dialogue: què feiavostè quan eraa Bulgària? (= what were
you doing when you were in Bulgaria?). It often combines withthe preterite to express what was going on when something elsehappened. Consider: mirava la tele, quan la Maria va arribar
(= I was watch ingtelevision, when Maria arrived). As in this
case, the imperfect often corresponds to ‘was’ + - ingending
in English.
2 The imperfect is also used to refer to habitual actions in the past,
in which it corresponds to English constructions with ‘used to’.Consider: quan era jove, jugava a tennis amb el meu germà cada
dia(= when I was young, I used to play tennis with my brother
every day).
An interesting feature of this dialogue is seria (= I would be).
Although this looks like an imperfect it is actually the conditionaltense of ser.The conditional will be introduced in Unit 18 but you
may want to keep this similarity in mind for later.
Exercise 4
Fill in the appropriate imperfect forms of the verbs in brackets in
the following sentences:
1 Fa sis anys, el Liam i jo _____ (viure) a Liverpool.
2 Quan l’Oriol i el Manuel _____ (ser) joves, _____ (anar) sovint
a la discoteca.
3 Tres o quatre vegades a la setmana, el Pere _____ (passejar)
per la platja.
4 Quan vaig arribar a casa seva, l’Albert _____ (llegir) el diari.5 Aquell dia, què _____ (fer) vostè?6 Quan et vaig telefonar, _____ (estar) dormint?
Exercise 5
Fill in the appropriate imperfect forms:
Quan tenia set anys, jo _____ (viure) al barri de Gràcia. Cada dia
_____ (anar) al col·legi local. _____ (agradar-se) molt jugar amb elsamics. Els meus amics i jo _____ (fer) moltes coses. La mevaactivitat preferida _____ (ser) pintar. Les activitats creatives i elsesports _____ (ser) fàcils. Però jo _____ (tenir) moltes diﬁcultats per1111

4 What was the ﬁnal outcome of his experience?198
Ei, Màrius!
Em preguntes com va anar per Barcelona l’any passat i què vaig
fer? Cada dia anava a classes de català a la universitat. Feiamòduls de filologia catalana. Era difícil però interessant i útilper mi. Per guanyar-me la vida donava classes d’anglès en unaacadèmia. Compartia el pis amb quatre mallorquins. Ens ho
passàvem molt bé i rèiem molt, eren uns tios collonuts.
Un dia jo anava pel carrer tranquil·lament, quan de sobte un
home em va preguntar si volia fer de model. Jo em pensava queho deia de conya, però ell va insistir, em va dir que em
semblava al David Beckham (quin fàstic!) i vaig acceptar perquè
pagaven molt bé. Pagaven mil euros per sessió, no està mal, oique no? No vaig dubtar gaire.
Amb els diners vaig comprar un cotxe de segona mà i vaig
viatjar per tota Espanya. Quin viatge, tio! Vaig visitar uns
amics al País Basc i vam anar d’escalada als 
Picos de Europa .
Era la bona vida, fins que es van acabar els diners i quan vaiganar a veure el tio de las fotos . . . havia desaparegut! Total,que tinc un deute com una catedral. Vaig tornar a Escòcia i

Culture note
This is an example of an informal style, with words of widespread
use but of informal register, some of which have appeared before,like tio, and some of which are slightly vulgar, like collonut and
de conya .
Language points
Riure is irregular in its stem: reia,reies ,reia,rèiem ,rèieu ,reien .
In the ﬁrst few lines James uses mainly the imperfect, referring
to things he was habitually doing (the things that he ‘used to do’ or
‘was doing’ while he was in Barcelona). But when he starts telling
the story about being given work as a model, James switches to thepreterite, because the emphasis is now on a sequence of events. Inhavia desaparegut (= he had disappeared) we hear an example of
thepluperfect tense, used for things that had happened before an
action in the past tense. It is formed with the imperfect of haver
and the past participle used to form the perfect tense.
Inguanyar-se la vida we see the verb guanyar ‘to gain’, ‘to win’
used as a reﬂexive: ‘to earn one’s (own) living’.
As we have already seen, the phrase passar-s’ho bé combines a
reﬂexive verb, passar-se ‘to pass one’s time’, with ho‘it’. There isn’t
really an English equivalent for the use of hoin this case. As you
will gather from the frequency with which this pronoun is used inCatalan, hoplays a very important role. It usually stands for an idea
already mentioned rather than for a speciﬁc noun. Its meaningcorresponds to ‘it’ (= this, that), although this does not always ﬁgure
in translation: no ho sé = ‘I don’t know (it)’, ho sento = ‘I’m sorry
(about it)’, or in passar-s’ho bé = ‘to have a good time (of it)’.
Remember that the pronoun goes before the verb, except after aninﬁnitive or command form.

Useful expressions
This dialogue introduces two verbs useful for discussion and
reaching agreement:
1Equivocar-se (= to make a mistake), which works as a reﬂexive.
2Tenir raó (= to be right), a way of conceding an argument (as in
the dialogue). It can also be used to indicate agreement, as in
tens raó , or simply to state that one is right: em sembla que tinc
raó(= I believe I am right).
Deixar is, like tenir and quedar , a verb of many uses. In this case
indeixar tranquil·la (= to leave alone, to leave in peace) it appears
with one of its main meanings: ‘to leave’.1111

The future tense 2
As we have seen in Unit 13, the future tense is straightforward to
form in all three conjugations, which take the same endings. In 
the dialogue we hear the third conjugation sortir which takes the
same endings as the model passar (sortir-é ,sortir-às ,sortir-à ,sortir-
em,sortir-eu ,sortir-an ). Note how second conjugation verbs like
prendre replace the ﬁnal ewith the standard set of endings
(prendré ,prendràs ,prendrà ,prendrem ,prendreu ,prendran ).
Several verbs change their stem slightly to form the future tense:
fer→faré etc.
anar→aniré etc.
tenir →tindré etc.
venir →vindré etc.
voler →voldré etc.
poder →podré etc.
valer →valdré etc.
saber →sabré etc.
haver →hauré etc.
Exclamations
Exclamations are a very common feature of Catalan. Note here the
difference between the two uses of aiin this dialogue. The ﬁrst ai!
expresses awareness of having made a mistake and implies apology.The repetition ai,ai,aitowards the end of the dialogue is used to
gently admonish and express mild concern. Listen carefully to thedifference in intonation.
Other common exclamations are: ei!,ep!,ui!,apa! ,au!,vinga! ,
que difícil! ,quina sorpresa! (see Grammar reference). Their
meaning depends very much on context and intonation. It takestime to know how to use them. At this stage it is useful to recog-nise them and to be aware of their function when you hear them;in time you will incorporate them into your own sentences.

Culture note
La Barceloneta and Montjuïc
La Barceloneta is Barcelona’s ﬁshing village, not far from the city
centre, next to the harbour on the north side. On the south is thehill of Montjuïc , Barcelona’s biggest recreation area with museums,
galleries and many sports facilities built for the Olympic Games
(1992).
Montserrat
The ‘serrated mountain’ (1,236m) is the setting of Catalonia’s
holiest place, the Monastery of Montserrat. El Pirineu is the
Pyrenees. Anar d’excursió (= mountain walking) is an important
part of Catalan life, as can be judged by the number of centres
excursionistes (= mountain walking clubs). The excursionista move-
ment played an important role during the years of Franco’s dicta-torship (1939–75) in preserving national identity.
Language point
Weather expressions
The standard way of asking about the weather is: quin temps fa?/
va fer?/farà? You can check the standard replies in the Language
builder. Most are expressions with fer, as in: fa bo (= it is nice) and
fa calor (= it is hot). Some use hi ha :hi ha núvols (= there are
clouds). The verbs ploure (= to rain) and nevar (= to snow) stand
on their own: plou orestà plovent (= it is raining), neva orestà
nevant . The word for rain is la pluja and the word for snow is 
la neu .1111

Culture note
Types of accommodation
There are different types of allotjament (m.) (= accommodation).
Un hotel tends to be at the top end of the quality and price 
range, un hostal should be mid-range and una pensió tends to 
be the cheapest option. More specialised are l’alberg (de joventut )
(= youth hostel), cases fonda (simple country hotels offering
regional cuisine) and cases de pagès orcases rurals (rural B&Bs).
There is a star-rating system on a blue plaque near the entrance.
Language points
The conditional
The conditional uses the same stems as the future. The two tenses
are very similar, and verbs that are irregular in one tense are irreg-ular in the other. All verbs have the same endings: -ia,-ies,-ia,
-íem ,-íeu,-ien (as you will remember, these are the same as the
imperfect endings of second and third conjugation verbs).
The conditional is used very much as the English ‘could’ or
‘would’. Consider:
Podria recomanar-me un hostal cèntric? 
(= Could you recommend an hostal in the centre of town?)
Podria recomanar-me un itinerari?
(= could you recommend an itinerary?)
Voldria llogar una habitació en una casa particular
(= I would like to rent a room in a private house).
Weak pronouns 6: position of object 
pronouns
In this dialogue we hear how emcan be used before or after the
combination verb + inﬁnitive: em podria donar and pot recomanar-
me. In both these cases emis an indirect object pronoun. Both posi-
tions are normal and the speaker could just as well have said
instead: podria donar-me orem pot recomanar . Another new form1111

of the object pronoun appears in localitzar-los (= to ﬁnd/locate
them). Los refers to hotels and is a direct object.
Notice also the abundant use of lias a third person indirect
object pronoun ( li donaré ,li puc donar , etc.) in this dialogue,
emphasising the deferential treatment of the enquirer. Refer to theGrammar reference for a full table of weak object pronouns in thesingular and plural.

Language point
Using the telephone
Digui is the standard form used to answer the telephone. It is the
equivalent of the English ‘hello’, although literally it is the vostè
command form of the verb dir, and means ‘(please) speak’. Another
command form in this dialogue, escolti (from escoltar = to listen),
is also often used in telephone conversations to introduce a newtopic or to draw the attention of the person at the other end of theline. Apunti (from apuntar = to note down) is a straightforward
example of the polite command form.
Exercise 2
Identify which people or things the weak object pronouns under-

Language point
The subjunctive
In previous dialogues, we have heard and seen many instances of
verbs ending in the characteristic -iform: digui ,perdoni ,escolti ,
miri,pari, etc. We indicated that this is a feature of many conver-
sations using vostè . Strictly speaking, this form belongs to a part of
the verb known as the subjunctive.
The endings of the subjunctive
The set of endings are very easy to form, as all verbs take almost
the same endings: -i,-is,-i,-em,-eu,-in. Simply take off the endings
-ar,-ir,-erfrom the inﬁnitive to form the stem, and add the endings.
For example:
parli ,parlis ,parli ,parlem ,parleu ,parlin
perdi ,perdis ,perdi ,perdem ,perdeu ,perdin
dormi ,dormis ,dormi ,dormim ,dormiu ,dormin
Note that the ‘we’ and ‘you’ plural endings are the same as the
present indicative tense ( parlo ,parles , etc.) in all conjugations.
The stem of the subjunctive
1 Most verbs retain the same stem in the ‘we’/‘you’ (plural) as the
present indicative:
anar→vagi (but anem ,aneu )
fer→faci(but fem,feu)
2 Others retain the subjunctive form throughout:
ser→sigui ,siguis ,sigui ,siguem ,sigueu ,siguin
voler →vulgui etc.
This pattern is followed by a group of verbs whose ﬁrst person
present tense ends in -c, like:
dir→dic→digui etc.
estar →estic→estigui etc.
prendre →prenc →prengui etc.1111

3Haver and saber have their own forms:
haver →hagi,hagis ,hagi,hàgim ,hàgiu ,hagin
saber →sàpiga ,sàpigues ,sàpiga ,sapiguem ,sapigueu ,
sàpiguen
The use of the subjunctive
In past units we have heard the subjunctive used to give commands
in the vostè form. In this dialogue we come across some of its other
main everyday uses:
1Quan + subjunctive to refer to an action in the future: quan
arribem a l’autopista (= when we reach the motorway); quan
arribi a l’aeroport (= when you arrive at the airport). Similarly:
quan vagi a estudiar a Hong Kong l’any que ve (= when I go to
study in Hong Kong next year). Other time expressions in thefuture behave in the same way. Consider: tornaré abans que
tanquin les botigues (= I’ll be back before the shops close); viuré
a casa dels pares ﬁns que (no) trobi un pis al centre (= I’ll live
at my parents’ until I ﬁnd a ﬂat in town).
2 When you want/request someone else to do something: vull que
pari a l’estació de Metro (= I want you to stop at the under-
ground station) and li recomano que vagi directament a facturar
l’equipatge (= I recommend you to go straight to check in your
luggage). Note that the main verb is followed by que and that a
change of subject is involved. Consider: (jo) vull que (tu) em
compris un regal quan vagis a Delhi (= I want you to buy me a
present when you go to Delhi). Notice how in all these examples
que + subjunctive is translated with an inﬁnitive in English.
Other verbs, such as those expressing emotions (likes, dislikes,
wishes and hopes), behave in the same way. Consider: no
m’agrada que escoltis música tot el dia ;espero que nevi aquest
cap de setmana .
3 Sentences starting with ésfollowed by quealso take the subjunc-
tive. There are two such sentences in Dialogue 1: com és possible
que hi hagi tants cotxes? and sí, és millor que agaﬁ el metro .
Another such sentence is és necessari que . . . and by extension
sentences that mean és necessari such as calwhich, as we have224

=== PAGE 246 ===

heard earlier, is as an economic way to express need. In Exercise
4, Situation 1, below, you will hear cal que faci transbord quan
arribi a València (= you have to change trains when you reach
Valencia), another example of this type of use.
4 When you want to form negative commands: no es preocupi, que
arribarem a temps (= don’t worry, we’ll get there on time).
Consider: no parlis tan de pressa, que no t’entenc (= don’t speak
so quickly, because I can’t understand you), or: no sigui així, Sr.
Sugranyes (= don’t be like that, Sr. Sugranyes).
The command form 4
As we have seen above, the subjunctive is used to express
commands or requests, except when addressing someone in the tu
form, in which case the form used is the third person singular of thepresent tense. We have heard many examples of requests using tu
forms: parla més a poc a poc (= speak more slowly); dóna’m el
mòbil (= give me the mobile); telefona la Rosa i la Txell (= phone
Rosa and Txell); dorm tranquil·lament (= sleep peacefully).
A few verbs have an irregular tuform:
anar→vés
fer→fes
ser→sigues
dir→digues
estar →estigues
tenir →té
Exercise 1
Now go back to Dialogue 1. Rachel has established an informal
rapport with the taxi driver and is using the tuform. Could you
change all the verb forms and the related weak pronouns accord-ingly?
Exercise 2
Rachel is travelling with her friend Sara. Listen to the alternative
dialogue and write down the verbs that were in the singular inDialogue 1 and are now in the plural.1111

Text 1 is an example of a programme of events of a typical festa
major in one of the lively popular neighbourhoods south of the
Eixample.
Culture note
Festes majors vary from place to place, but there are core activities
which are incorporated in many festes , like castellers ,gegants and
cap-grossos . Music, dancing ( els balls ) and ﬁreworks seem never to
be lacking. Festes majors also often offer the opportunity of taking
part in la sardana (the traditional circle dance). Another distinctive
feature is the correfoc , literally ‘running ﬁre(works)’, organised by
(a càrrec de )els diables (= devils) who run through the streets with
ﬁreworks attached to sticks which they wave about in their devil
costumes through the crowd-lined streets and squares. Els gegants
means ‘giants’ and refers to the giant-size models of kings, queens
and other historical and legendary characters (4–5m tall) carried bythe groups of geganters or giant-carriers. The cap-grossos (literally:
‘big heads’, made of papier mâché), alongside other fairytale-likemonsters like the drac (= dragon), often accompany the gegants ,
who parade through the festa major to the sound of traditional live
music and percussion. The ofﬁcial festa major parade is known as
thecercavila or ‘street parade’. The gegants periodically stop and
dance along the way. Festes majors are also ofﬁcial and religious
occasions, and this is marked by the pregó or ofﬁcial opening speech
that traditionally is presided over by local dignitaries, municipalofﬁcials, the festa organisers and the guest of honour who usually
delivers the speech.
Text 2
The festa website receives numerous emails expressing a variety of
opinions. Below are some of the messages received:
1Visca les festes! Som el millor barri de Barcelona i amb les millors
festes: ambient magníﬁc, gent de totes les edats, cultures i races.Em semblen unes festes genials i participatives. Fins i tot m’hanagradat més aquest any que l’any passat. Felicitats als
organitzadors. Elian (Mataró).1111

2Quines festes! No tinc paraules per descriure-les. Han estat més
divertides que mai. Jo no sóc d’aquí, però sempre m’ha agradat molt 
el barri, i m’ho he passat molt bé a les festes aquest any. 
El macroconcert va ser genial. I els concerts que s’han fet a la plaça
han estat molt bé totes les nits. Em va agradar molt el concert dels
Pets a la plaça. Va ser força divertit, crec que els organitzadorsmereixen la més sincera felicitació per la meva part. Molt i molt bé!
Visca la festa major! Rosina (Barcelona).
3Distingits senyors organitzadors,
Fa cinquanta-tres anys que visc en aquest barri i em fa moltíssima
vergonya que em relacionin amb les FESTES. A mi em sembla claríssim
que ja no són com eren abans. Abans eren festes pels veïns, amb uns
horaris normals. No com ara. Ara les festes són només pels joves i
acaben a les quatre de la matinada. Ara no hi ha respecte per la gentd’aquí. No m’agrada gens ni mica l’actitud de molts joves del barri.Sempre que puc, marxo del barri a partir de la segona setmana de
setembre, perquè durant les festes no s’hi pot viure.
Atentament, Enric Sugranyes (veí d’aquest barri de tota la vida).
Exercise 1
Elian, Rosina and Sr. Sugranyes feel so strongly about the festes
that they decide to phone the organisers. Listen to the messages
they leave. Can you decide which voice message (a, b, or c) corre-
sponds to which email (1. Elian, 2. Rosina, 3. Sr. Sugranyes)?
Exercise 2
Using the programme and the texts above, write a postcard
describing a day at a festa major . If at all possible, show it to a
Catalan speaker. You may even be able ﬁnd a tandem partner to
send it to over the internet.
Text 3
After a festa major you may want to get away from the excitementof the city. Mas Ses Vinyes combines a rural setting with views over
the Costa Brava.232

=== PAGE 254 ===

By now you may be conﬁdent enough to send simple emails in
preparation for a holiday. Perhaps something as simple as: em
podria enviar informació sobre com arribar-hi?
Isabel, the manager, sent the following response:
• Li envio un plànol de la zona que complementa el que hi ha a la web;
és un croquis de com arribar a l’hotel Mas Ses Vinyes tant si ve des deGirona com si ve de Barcelona.• Si ve des de Girona està a 40 km, 0,5 hores; si ho fa de Barcelonaestà a uns 110 km, 1,5 hores si no hi ha tràﬁc intens com passa al’estiu. Hi ha una línia d’autobusos SARFA que fa la línia regularBarcelona–Girona i passa per Palafrugell. Té uns horaris força amplis i téweb pròpia per consultar-ho. És la carretera que va de Palafrugell aBegur, nosaltres estem a 1 km de Palafrugell, és la Gip 6531.
Li envio aquest missatge amb el ﬁtxer corresponent al plànol.

Language points
Impersonal es
This is a common construction, particularly with poder .Es pot
fumar aquí? (= can one smoke here?); es pot aparcar? (= can one
park (here)?), or, as in the text: on es pot gaudir d’una estada domi-
nada per la calma . . . (= where one can enjoy a stay surrounded by
calm . . .), etc. You will hear this construction applied to many other
verbs. It is formed with the third person of the verb and the thirdperson reﬂexive pronoun es. Consider: es menja
bé en aquest
restaurant? (= does one eat well in this restaurant?); com es fa això?
(= how does one do this? orhow is it done?).234

Weak pronouns 7: combination of 
pronouns
As you become more conﬁdent with your Catalan, you will ﬁnd that
there are uses of the pronouns and, above all, combinations ofpronouns which require some close attention and which have not
been covered in this course. To prepare you for further develop-
ments there are two points you might want to keep in mind:
1 It is important to be able to distinguish between direct and in-
direct objects.
2 Most combinations of pronouns combine direct and indirect
objects, so remember that the indirect comes ﬁrst and theconnection between the two sounds is established according torules you are already familiar with. Beginning to distinguishdirect and indirect pronouns will in itself lead you to an under-standing of pronoun combinations through hearing them andeventually using them.
Consider these examples:
1L
AURA Mira, la Maritxell, vols que te la presenti?
RACHEL Sí, presenta- me-la . La vull conèixer.

If you have the opportunity, you could look at the Mas Ses Vinyes
or a similar web page to explore further. For example, you couldﬁnd out the cost of the rooms.1111

Text 5
Acabem amb una carta d’un metge de Menorca que conté un toc de
nostàlgia:236
CRÒNICA DEIS AVATARS D’UN METGE DE POBLE
Per casualitat vaig arribar a Menorca a fer de metge ara fa 
30 anys. L’illa em va captivar per la seva calma, la seva
lluminositat resplendent i la transparència de las seves aigües.
La seva gent fàcil i senzilla em van guanyar per la seva
generositat i agraïment.
El metge d’un poble era en aquella època una ﬁgura
rellevant. Al seu càrrec estava la cura de la salut de tota la
família, els nens, els vells, les dones embarassades, durant
totes les hores del dia i tots els dies de l’any. Calia estar en
bona relació amb el metge, i no s’abusava de la seva atenció.
Tot sovint abans de consultar-lo es recorria a remeis casolans obastava una indicació per telèfon.
Poc a poc amb la millora del nivell de vida i dels mitjans de
transport, l’augment del nombre de professionals i del canvi delsistema sanitari, la ﬁgura tradicional del metge del poble ha
anat desapareixent.
Actualment en el mateix poble hi ha dos metges i un
pediatra, més un servei d’urgències les 24 hores, s’ha creat una
gran demanda de consulta especialitzada i . . . la ﬁgurarellevant del metge de poble ha anat desapareixent.
A canvi de la relació pròxima i personal de fa anys, la
població ha guanyat una assistència més moderna i més
recursos i el metge ha guanyat suport, tranquil·litat i temps
lliure.
Menorca ha estat un destí per molta gent d’altres latituds
que ha vingut a instal·lar-se a l’illa. Els que van arribar fa
anys eren pocs i van integrar-se fàcilment dins la poblaciónativa. En l’actualitat hi ha tendència a formar col·lectivitats
de diferent procedència, moltes vegades autosuﬁcients, però els
descendents van a la escola i aprenen el català, a més del
castellà, l’anglès o l’alemany.
El foraster ha deixat de ser una ﬁgura singular per
convertir-se en una ﬁgura habitual en el panorama 
insular.

The strong pronouns are the subject pronouns and the pronoun
forms used with a preposition. For example, a tu,amb mi ,per ell ,
etc. They are called ‘strong’ because they are pronounced inde-
pendently with full force in comparison to the ‘weak’ pronouns
which are unstressed and pronounced as part of the verb theyaccompany.
Because weak pronouns form a unit with the verb, they are
written in four different ways. See next chart.1111

Basic guidelines for comparison of serand estar
Only ‘ser’ is used:
1) To tell the time: Són les tres, és dilluns.
2) With numbers: Són 30 euros.
3) When pronouns follow ser: És ell, és aquesta.
4) To express: identity, profession, inherent and permanent char-
acteristics: És valencià, és professor, és de plàstic, és la solució.244

=== PAGE 266 ===

Only ‘estar’ is used:
1) With adverbs and adverbial expressions: Està molt bé; Elles
estan d’acord.
2) To express temporary states likely to change or the result of
change: El Joan està content; la Marina està preocupada.
3) To form the continuous tenses: El Pere està parlant per telèfon.
Both ‘ser’ and ‘estar’ can be used:
1) To indicate location: Some speakers would always use estar .
Others make a distinction between location when they would useser,and location linked to a time limit when they would use estar .
Consider: Ja som a Girona; hi estarem tres hores. 
2) To express temporary states or qualities with inanimate subjects
followed by a past participle or an adjective: “el banc és/està
tancat”; “la llet és/està calenta”.

Exercise 6
Activity 1: cel = sky/heaven, ona = wave.
Activity 2:
Els bars són un aspecte molt important de la vida mediterrànea i
de la vida catalana . Moltes persones passen més d’una hora al dia
al bar . És un centre social on es formen i desenvolupen les rela -
cions personals i professionals . Un eslògan publicitari diu que el
nom de la ciutat de Barcelona conté els ingredients principals
de la vida barcelonina: BAR – CEL – ONA. ‘Bar’ ésevident , ‘cel’
es refereix a l’atmosfera (celestial ) i ‘ona’ són les ondulacions que
provoca el moviment del mar. Molt apropiat .
Bars are a very important aspect of Mediterranean and Catalan life.
Many people spend more than one hour a day in a bar. It is a socialcentre where personal and professional relationships are formedand developed. An advertising slogan says that the name of the cityof Barcelona contains the main ingredients of life in Barcelona:BAR – CEL – ONA. Bar is obvious, ‘cel’ refers to the sky, and‘ona’ to the waves caused by the movement of the sea. Most appropriate.

In the nineteenth century Barcelona was a very small city. It
consisted only of that part of town which now contains the districts
of El Raval and the old city. An important section of the old city
is the Gothic Quarter, the district favoured by many tourists andvisitors. It has very important historical buildings, for example theCathedral or the Saló del Tinell. At the end of the nineteeth centurythe construction of the Eixample was the result of the industrial
revolution and it contains buildings by many famous architects like
Domènech i Montaner, Puig i Cadafalch and the most famous ofthem all, Antoni Gaudí. L’Eixample connects Barcelona with othercentres of population which are nowadays districts of Barcelona.For instance, there is the popular district of Gràcia, where theatmosphere is made very pleasant by the large number of cafés,1111

Eduard,
He agafat un taxi a l’estació de Sants per anar a l’aeroport i hi
havia molt trànsit. Jo volia agafar el metro però tenia la maleta i eltaxista ha dit que em podria portar directament a l’aeroport. Peròno tenia trenta euros per pagar el taxista! Al ﬁnal he agafat el metroi el tren i he arribat a l’aeroport amb només cinc minuts per facturar
l’equipatge! Una abraçada, Rachel.

quina és la millor manera d’anar-hi? Que hi ha un tren per anar aGranollers?Sí, però prefereixo anar amb tren. Em pot dir si hi ha consigna aSants? Quan arribi a Sants, voldria deixar-hi l’equipatge.
Quant val?
Sap de quina via surt el tren a Sants?Molt bé. Em pot dir si hi ha un tren després de les tres?Potser és millor que vagi amb autocar. No tindré gaire temps perla connexió a Sants i arribaré més aviat a Granollers.
